  <h2>Research Notes</h2>
  <p>Working notes from building agentic systems under discipline.
  These documents were produced by LLMs as part of the research process.
  They have not been independently verified. They are starting material, nothing more.</p>
  <p>The value isn't in the analysis — it's in what the analysis was built on:
  208 session decisions, 724 commits, and a human who kept saying
  "no, that's not right" until it was.</p>
