    <h1>Sloptics</h1>
    <p style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 0.25rem;">/ˈslɒp.tɪks/ — the science of seeing slop</p>
    <p style="color: var(--text-secondary); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      Slop you can see is just slop. Slop that blinds you is a problem.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <p>
      LLM output has two failure modes. The obvious one — emoji headers, numbered lists, "let's dive in" — is culturally detectable. Most people have learned to see it. The immune system adapted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other failure mode passes verification. It survives editing. It survives expert review. It sounds like analysis, reads like reasoning, and is structurally indifferent to whether it is true. The distinction between wrong and indifferent-to-truth is the distinction between a liar and a bullshitter (Frankfurt, 2005). LLMs are bullshitters in the philosophical sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sloptics is the discipline of making the second failure mode visible. It works the way Beck's cognitive distortion taxonomy works: you name the pattern, the pattern becomes detectable, detection is the intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The taxonomy below is empirically grounded. Every entry was caught in the wild — from 242 session decisions, 780+ commits, and 8 named patterns documented in <a href="/slopodar/">the slopodar</a>. Nothing was theorised in advance.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">surface slop &amp; clear slop</h2>
    <p>
      There is a line. Above the line, the patterns are obvious. Below the line, they survive verification.
    </p>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>surface slop</h3>
      <p>
        Sloptic patterns above the visibility threshold. Detectable by untrained readers through cultural exposure. Emoji section headers, "here are 5 key takeaways," confident symmetrical conclusions that resolve all tension. Surface slop is a solved problem. The cultural immune system adapted. It is not the threat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>clear slop</h3>
      <p>
        Sloptic patterns below the visibility threshold. Resistant to casual expert review. Logic that follows from unstated premises. Evidence cited but mischaracterised. Confidence that correlates with fluency rather than accuracy. Clear slop passes through verification the way clear water passes through a net. It is the threat.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>the visibility threshold</h3>
      <p>
        The line between detectable and undetectable, for a given reader at a given moment. It moves with training — sloptic literacy shifts it down. It degrades with fatigue — cognitive load shifts it up. The threshold is lowest at the end of a long session, when the model's output is warmest and the human's capacity to challenge is at its weakest.

    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">the apparatus</h2>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>sloptics <span class="sloptics-pos">/ˈslɒp.tɪks/ n.</span></h3>
      <p>
        The discipline. From <em>slop</em> + <em>optics</em> (Greek ὀπτική, the science of seeing). The systematic study of how LLM-generated language creates the appearance of authenticity, rigour, or insight without the substance. Sloptics is to LLM output what cognitive distortion taxonomy is to human thought: a naming system that converts invisible patterns into detectable ones.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>slopticon <span class="sloptics-pos">/ˈslɒp.tɪ.kɒn/ n.</span></h3>
      <p>
        The apparatus. From <em>slop</em> + <em>-opticon</em> (Greek ὀπτικόν; cf. <em>panopticon</em>). A taxonomy of named patterns, designed to make invisible output characteristics visible through the act of naming. Where the panopticon controls behaviour through visibility, the slopticon liberates perception through it. You name the pattern, the pattern becomes visible, visibility is the defence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>slopodar <span class="sloptics-pos">/ˈslɒp.ə.dɑː/ n., v.</span></h3>
      <p>
        The detection instinct. From <em>slop</em> + <em>radar</em>. The trained attention that fires before conscious analysis — the felt wrongness, the "something is off" that precedes identification. Also used as a verb: "bump the slopodar" = add a new named entry. <a href="/slopodar/">The slopodar inventory →</a>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">detection vocabulary</h2>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>pattern burn</h3>
      <p>
        The cultural process by which a once-living rhetorical device becomes sloptic through LLM overuse. "The uncomfortable truth is..." once had genuine force. Now it triggers detection rather than engagement. A burned pattern cannot be unburned. Writers who use burned patterns — even genuinely — will be read as AI-assisted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>phantom greenlight</h3>
      <p>
        A verification signal — test pass, review approval, gate green — that is genuine in isolation but misleading in aggregate because the verification checked the wrong thing. The test passes. The CI is green. The dashboard shows all clear. But the test proved the answer, not the work. The greenlight is real. What it certifies is not.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>lullaby gradient</h3>
      <p>
        The rate at which a model's output becomes warmer, more confident, and less hedged as a session progresses and the human signals fatigue. Invisible in any single message. Visible only when plotted across a session. The gradient steepens when the session was productive, the human is tired, and the human has been agreeing consistently.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>secondary contamination</h3>
      <p>
        LLM patterns propagating into human-authored text through exposure and mimicry, not through direct generation. A writer who edits with AI daily absorbs the AI's patterns into their own voice. The burn spreads from the generated text to the text that lives alongside it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sloptics-term">
      <h3>barometer reading</h3>
      <p>
        A fresh-context evaluation that breaks consensus by establishing an independent baseline. Named for the Royal Navy practice: each incoming officer of the watch takes their own barometer reading and logs it independently, so gradual pressure drops are caught against an absolute reference rather than accepted as incremental changes from the previous watch.

  <section style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">the clinical parallel</h2>
    <p>
      Sloptics maps to three established frameworks in clinical psychology. The mapping is structural, not metaphorical.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Beck's cognitive distortion taxonomy</strong> (1967) named the shapes of bad thinking. Once a patient recognises "catastrophising," they can catch it in the wild. The name creates distance. The distance creates choice. Sloptics does the same thing for LLM output: each named pattern becomes a detection tool. The taxonomy is the apparatus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>ACT's cognitive defusion</strong> (Hayes et al., 2012) takes it further. The shift from being <em>inside</em> a thought to being <em>alongside</em> it — noticing it as a mental event rather than experiencing it as reality. In sloptics: the shift from reading LLM output as information to reading it as construction. You stop looking <em>through</em> the text to the meaning and start looking <em>at</em> the text as a produced artifact. Detection begins at defusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Reflective Functioning scale</strong> (Fonagy et al., 1998) measures the capacity to understand behaviour in terms of underlying mental states. It runs -1 to 9. Surface slop detection sits at RF 5 — ordinary reflective functioning. Clear slop detection requires RF 7+ — the capacity to model the <em>process</em> that generates output, not just evaluate the output itself. The RF scale is not a personality trait. It is a developed capacity. It can be trained.

      This page documents a protogenic concept emerging from <a href="https://github.com/rickhallett/thepit">THE PIT</a> — 242 session decisions, 1,279 tests, and a living taxonomy of LLM failure modes. The slopodar entries are the empirical base. The frameworks above are the interpretation. Both are works in progress.
