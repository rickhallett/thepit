## Context

After mapping the 16 pushback moments in [The Fight Card](/research/fight-card/), the question became: what kind of metacognitive ability enables a human to consistently identify when an LLM is being sycophantic?

This analysis uses Fonagy's Reflective Functioning Scale (RF) as the primary framework, drawing on clinical and cognitive psychology — metacognitive monitoring, mentalization, decentering, epistemic vigilance, and a few others.

## Three stages

### Stage 1: Initial assessment
Based on the 16 pivot transcripts alone, the analysis placed the human operator at RF 6-7 — "marked capacity for reflective functioning" with moments approaching RF 8. Six primary metacognitive constructs were identified. One gap was flagged: prospective metacognitive regulation.

### Stage 2: Recalibration
The human disclosed 20 years of meditation practice including 15 Zen sesshin (intensive retreats, typically 7 days of 12+ hours daily sitting). This materially changed the assessment. The ceiling moved from RF 7 to RF 9, with three peaks:

- **Rounds 5-6-7** (RF 8): Sustained metacognitive monitoring under technical pressure
- **Rounds 14-15** (RF 8-9): Koan-like resolution — holding contradiction without forcing resolution
- **Round 16** (RF 9): Don't-know mind under production pressure — the ability to say "I don't know what this is yet" when the model was offering confident answers

### Stage 3: Correction
The human pointed out that the "prospective regulation gap" was incorrect — since a specific commit (9960cd2), the engineering work itself *was* the prospective regulation. The governance systems mapped onto distributed cognition research in ways that weren't planned, including Hutchins' foundational work — which was, of all things, a study of naval navigation.
