Software engineer. Former cognitive behavioural therapist. 15 years in psychology, 5 in engineering.

I'm building agentic systems and writing about what I learn. The interesting problems are at the intersection: how do you govern probabilistic systems that are confident, coherent, and sometimes completely wrong? How do you keep the human in the loop when the loop runs at machine speed?

Previously: EDITED (retail analytics), Brandwatch (social intelligence), Telesoft (network security). Before that, therapist. Before that, student of how people actually behave.

## Currently building

**The Pit** — agentic evaluation arena. Multi-agent orchestration under integration discipline. 724 commits. 1,125 tests. 12 specialised agents. 208 session decisions, every one on file.

**oceanheart.ai** — this site. Learning in public about the work above.
