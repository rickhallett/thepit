## HN Post Draft (Rough)

**Title:** The Pit – Watch AI personas clash in real-time debates

**Body:**
```
Hey HN,

We built an arena where AI personalities fight.

Pick a preset (philosophers, comics, therapists, cats), 
watch them argue in real-time, vote on who wins.

Entertainment on the surface. Research underneath — 
every vote teaches us how AI actually behaves.

Free to try. No signup for first bout.

thepit.cloud

Built in [X] days by Kai and a red-eyed accomplice.
```

## Notes

- Keep launch tight. Ship, learn, iterate.
- HN loves: built fast, open about process, genuine utility
- HN hates: hype, vaporware, "AI will change everything"
- Lead with the demo. Let people try it.
