## How to use this document

^Cpts Log: oh you absolute *darlings* honestly...this is the kind of team I can trust.

Each test has:
- **Step** — exactly what to do
- **Expected** — what should happen if working correctly
- **[ ]** — tick it off
- **Notes** — write what you actually saw

Mark results as:
- **PASS** — works as expected
- **SOFT** — works but rough, acceptable for launch
- **FAIL** — broken, blocks launch or creates bad first impression
- **SKIP** — not tested this pass

The priority column tells you what matters for HN:
- **P0** — must work. A failure here means delay launch.
- **P1** — should work. A failure here is embarrassing but survivable.
- **P2** — nice to verify. Note issues for post-launch.

Not for me, but I am the maker. Also, side note but relevant, having the full 12 as the default preset on sonnet during demo mode...this is stacking up costs if we find success. The question really comes down to this: will HN care between haiku/sonnet/opus? How do we know? What is our best approximation of risk to cost? How significant do these things feel compared to the risk of someone else getting here first, which I personally, think grows by the minute. |

It matters more that it is consistent, then coherent, that makes it defensible. Right now it is none of those things without bullshitting)<br><br>Note: I am of the opinion we should drop Opus. Who needs opus for a sim like this, really? It sounds absurd. Maybe it isnt to DS, though. Honestly, I need the analyst/architect on this one. Sonnet 4.6 is out now, and its better than Opus 4.6, probably quicker and cheaper as well |

| 4.3.1 | Start a bout with a premium model (Sonnet/Opus if available) | Model selector shows premium options. Bout starts with the selected model. | P1  | [x]    | FAIL see above, no obvious difference in premium, plus honestly it feels too gimmicky for release onto HN in a TOUCHY area. We should strip all this crap out, have a very sane, sensible pricing model that would cover us in a death hug, and just put the thing to bed for now. It was premature business model optimisation, that is all. Captains orders. |

### 6.2 Mobile (Known Rough)

Open `thepit.cloud` on your phone. The goal here is to document what you see, not to expect perfection.

| # | Step | Expected | Pri | Result | Notes |

| 6.2.4 | Start a bout on mobile | Streaming works. Turns readable. | P1 | [ ] | |
| 6.2.5 | **Check credit history table on mobile** | **Known issue:** Table horizontally scrolls off-screen. Document how far it scrolls and whether a scroll hint (gradient fade) is visible. | P1 | [ ] | Known issue — document severity. |
| 6.2.6 | Navigate to `/agents/<any-id>` on mobile | **Known issue:** ETH hashes (prompt hash, manifest hash) may bleed past viewport on the agent panel. Document what you see. | P1 | [ ] | Known issue — document severity. |
| 6.2.7 | Check pricing section on mobile | Three plan cards should stack vertically. Prices readable. CTAs tappable. | P1 | [ ] | |

| 6.2.9 | Navigate to `/leaderboard` on mobile | Leaderboard renders. Note any horizontal overflow in the dashboard tables. | P1 | [ ] | |
| 6.2.10 | Overall mobile impression | Is it usable? Would an HN reader on their phone think "this is rough but functional" or "this is broken"? | P0 | [ ] | Write honest assessment. |

### 6.3 Secondary Browser (if time)

| # | Step | Expected | Pri | Result | Notes |
|---|------|----------|-----|--------|-------|

### Launch Readiness Assessment

**Overall verdict:** _(fill in after testing)_

- [ ] **GREEN** — Ship it. No P0 failures. Known issues documented and acceptable.
- [ ] **YELLOW** — Ship with caveats. 1–2 P0 softs that need same-day hotfix attention.
- [x] **RED** — Hold. P0 failures that would embarrass us on HN.

### Things That Surprised You (good or bad)

_Write anything here that stood out — things better than expected, things that feel off even if technically functional, copy that reads weird, interactions that felt slow, moments of delight._

- Went to cancel pitlab subscription on rickhallett@icloud (github sso) account. Found 2 subscriptions both next billing date 19 mar 2026, and 2 identical mastercards, both invoiced same day (did I do this twice myself, or did it double? I suspect the former, but that should have been gated) (FYI I cancelled both, my pitlab sub is obvious still active until renewal date, but thats good)
- Should the battle complete modal display before the user has had a chance to vote, really? I think probably not, in case it seems like we are trying to optimise virality over voting
- Re-rolling a bout doesn't make sense as an option on a preset, unless we default to pre-selecting those agents on the next page. And then we would need to inject the prompt we use to generate that preset. Its either that or we hide that button unless it is a custom bout. From a UX and hacker-friendly POV, I would want to be able to re-mix presets. If we had no launch pressure, I would say build it, its just state management. But because of that, and multiple reds already and I'm barely partway through this, my appetite for more chaos is reducing rapidly. Put it on the roadmap, done. Concept still lives in the minds of the audience.
- Liking bout messages when authed doesnt persist on page reload. Also, users would expect it to go red when toggled; too many repetitions for that to simply not be the case. Just invites confusion. We dont want that.
- 'fire' emoji message when already incremented after page refresh will sometimes bump to 2 before immediate reset to 1. At other times, it will allow you to increment to 2, and stay there, until refresh, when it 'reverts' to 1. I am not going to give this any more time simply for the fact that at this point we have lost trust in the average user, let alone the discerning one. This is classic react state management problems; nasty, but classic.
- Appended to above: note, sometimes the heart icon does, in fact, go red. I am truly glad this is not an actual cockpit in an actual plan, and we had traffic control on headspeaker, let alone loud speaker.
- Wait, sorry I've lost my senses a moment there- so yes the icons should be coloured ALL the time, no toggle. The flame threw me off for some reason.
- What, btw, exactly DO we mean by the fire emoji?
- There is confusion for me about whether or not the preview at the top of the replay page has the correct number of likes/fires; I could do this as a calm QA with resources, but I am a stressed captain who feels he has, at best, to get this aircraft airworthy and I was reassured by entire panel this morning that it was, I just needed to check it. I knew better than to fully trust that, but that is a non-trivial team error.

-  At this point I spoke with Mr Weaver. Agreed on C:

Option C: What you're not thinking of
Complete the QA pass as a read-only inventory. Don't mark things pass/fail against a launch bar. Mark them as "observed state."
Here's the logic:
1. You're already in the product. You have context, flow state, and a testing mindset. That's expensive to rebuild.
2. The value of continuing isn't "does this pass launch?" — you already know the answer is no, not today. The value is "what is the complete list of things that need to be true before launch?"
3. Walk the rest of the checklist. Don't fix. Don't debug. Just record what you see. "Contact form 500." "Reactions flicker." "Share link copies wrong thing." Fast, observational, no investigation.
4. When you're done, you have a complete defect inventory — not a partial one. That inventory becomes the authoritative work list.
5. Then we triage that list once, as a team, and build a single prioritised fix sequence. One branch, sequential PRs, gate after each.
Why this is better than A or B:
- Unlike A, you don't lose the testing context and momentum you've already built.
- Unlike B, there's no parallel mutation. The codebase stays frozen while you observe. Fixes happen after the inventory is complete.
- The fix sequence is informed by the full picture, not the partial one. You might find that 3 of the reaction bugs are the same root cause. You might find that sections 3–7 are mostly clean. You don't know yet.
The timeline implication: Your QA pass takes another 30–45 minutes of observation. Then we triage. Then we fix. If the fix list is tractable, we can still make Tuesday. If it's not, we know that honestly rather than discovering it mid-fix.

One More Thing
You said the team reassured you this was airworthy and you needed to check it. You were right to check. That is exactly why the Captain walks the QA — because 1,046 passing tests tell you the components work in isolation. They do not tell you the product works as a human experiences it. The reaction state management issues you found are a perfect example: every individual API call probably succeeds, but the client-side state reconciliation is broken in ways no unit test covers.
The team error wasn't reassuring you. The team error was not having a human walk the product earlier. That's on all of us, and it's a process lesson for after launch.
My recommendation: Option C. Finish the inventory. Then we fix with full information.

Previous bout started well, really well, premium, 36 turns....almost, stopped about a third of the way through, refreshed the page just to see what would happened. The 'arena short-circuited' with a partial render of what looks like the next message off the bottom of the page that got clipped.

Refreshed again, just to see, its off on its way again, continuing what was started. Technically intruiging, although the initial 'wow they are showing sides of humanity, here, like relatable ones' is quickly fading to repetitiveness.

Sometimes the markdown render gets messed around by a non-closing tag, which inverts the italicisation and blows the formatting into something pretty rough looking. Readable, if you are patient. Anthropologically, it is interesting that I am getting very bored of hearing this lot now, feeling more AI skeptical, practically gushing a few minutes ago. Very confident a large section of HN/othernetwork is starting to check out partially if not completely at this point. Either way, it points to my intuition that shorter and sweeter I think is, on average, a better move until we have some traction - some trust - on which to create more leverage in terms of creativity.
Christ. This is probably a replication of some reddit board somewhere. Painful. Truly.

The more often I see messages cut short the more often I think "why wasnt this fixed?"

Last message ended on a ... from The Mediator

- Despite our issues getting there, the replay of it renders just fine, start to finish (message truncation excepted)

- -22.45 credits, yikes. They wont like that....or at least, I fear they might not. Understandably, I am a little jumpy at this point in spacetime. Ref: lmTXQ6iio2WmeRye_ajry

**End of test script. Good luck, Captain.**

Back to you, Mr Weaver. You know what to do. I think, here, thats present it back to me. Probably help me know I'm only partly insane, partially incompetent, definitely finite, dealing with some pretty major speed shift vectors here as we go from agent mode to holy crap its spreadsheet in Obsidian markdown mode, watching my baby sing, watching her die, watching her come back to life, and so on.

A little melodramatic, perhaps. Please forgive the tired, slurred lazy typing.

Thank you for all of your efforts.
You are an inspiration.
