---

## 1. Completeness Check

All 146 SD numbers from SD-001 through SD-146 are present as primary definitions (table row or `###` heading). No gaps. No duplicates at the definition level.

**Result: PASS**

---

## 2. Out-of-Order Entries

### Zone 1: Lines 242-248 (2026-02-24 Launch Day session) [CAPTAIN REVIEW]

The entries SD-095 through SD-100 are scrambled. They appear in this order in the file:

| Line | SD Number | Expected Position | Actual Position | Displacement |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 242 | SD-094 | 94th | 94th | in-order |
| 243 | **SD-096** | 96th | 95th slot | +1 (appears before SD-095) |
| 244 | **SD-100** | 100th | 96th slot | +4 (appears before SD-095, SD-097, SD-098, SD-099) |
| 245 | **SD-099** | 99th | 97th slot | +2 |
| 246 | **SD-098** | 98th | 98th slot | appears after SD-099 (inverted) |
| 247 | **SD-097** | 97th | 99th slot | -2 |
| 248 | **SD-095** | 95th | 100th slot | -5 (appears last, should be first in this group) |
| 249 | SD-101 | 101st | 101st | in-order (resumes sequence) |

**File order:** SD-094, SD-096, SD-100, SD-099, SD-098, SD-097, SD-095, SD-101
**Expected order:** SD-094, SD-095, SD-096, SD-097, SD-098, SD-099, SD-100, SD-101

**Likely cause:** These SDs were recorded during high-tempo Round Table operations (RT L3 through RT L5) on Launch Day. SD-095 (The Main Thread) was likely written after the fact as a standing order derived from the RT L3/L4 experience, and SD-096-SD-100 were recorded as results came back from parallel subagent dispatches, not in numerical sequence. The numbers were assigned chronologically (by when the decision was made), but appended to the file in the order they were completed or synthesized.

**Evidence:** SD-096 references "per SD-095" in its text, confirming SD-095 was conceptually prior even though it appears after SD-096 in the file.

### Zone 2: Line 294 (end of file) [CAPTAIN REVIEW]

| Line | SD Number | Expected Position | Actual Position | Displacement |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 278 | SD-130 | 130th | 130th | in-order |
| 279 | **SD-132** | 132nd | 131st slot | +1 (appears before SD-131) |
| 280 | SD-133 | 133rd | 132nd slot | in-order relative to SD-132 |
| ... | SD-134 through SD-146 | | | in-order |
| 294 | **SD-131** | 131st | 146th slot | -15 (appears at very end of file, after SD-146) |

**File order:** ...SD-130, SD-132, SD-133, SD-134, ..., SD-146, SD-131
**Expected order:** ...SD-130, SD-131, SD-132, SD-133, ..., SD-146

**Likely cause:** SD-131 ("Going light" -- EXECUTED) was appended at the end of the file after a sequence of entries (SD-132 through SD-146) had already been recorded. The decision was made earlier (it supersedes SD-102) but the full record was written later, possibly during or after the red-light debrief (SD-133, SD-136). The chronological events: SD-131 (going light executed) triggered SD-132 (Show HN ready), then SD-133 (Weaver dismissed / red-light failure identified) -- but SD-131's full record was appended after SD-146.

## 3. Duplicate SD Numbers

No SD number appears more than once as a primary definition (table row `| SD-NNN |` or heading `### SD-NNN`).

Several SDs are **referenced** multiple times within the text of other SD entries (as back-references or cross-references). This is correct behaviour -- these are citations, not duplicate definitions. Examples:

- SD-083 referenced in SD-100's text (signed-commit analogy)
- SD-095 referenced in SD-096's text (Main Thread protection)
- SD-102, SD-103 referenced in SD-131's text (supersession)
- SD-104, SD-105 referenced in SD-115's text
- SD-119, SD-120, SD-121, SD-122 cross-referenced in SD-123
- SD-134 referenced in SD-141's text (true_north pseudocode)
- SD-142 referenced in SD-146's text

**Result: PASS -- no duplicate definitions**

---

## 4. Gaps in Numbering

Checked every integer from 1 to 146. All present as primary definitions.

**Result: PASS -- no gaps**

---

## 5. Self-Referential Entry

SD-119 contains "Back-reference: SD-119" -- a self-reference. This is intentional (the entry explicitly states it is a prototype placeholder that references itself). Not an error.

---

## 6. Structural Note

SD-031 through SD-036 use `### SD-NNN:` heading format instead of the table format (`| SD-NNN | ... |`) used by all other entries. This is a formatting inconsistency, not a numbering issue. These entries are in correct sequential order.

---

## 7. Suggested Reordering Plan [CAPTAIN REVIEW]

Two options:

### Option A: Reorder to strict sequential (recommended for machine parsing)

Move the 7 displaced entries to their numerically correct positions:

1. **Zone 1 (lines 242-248):** Reorder the block to: SD-094, SD-095, SD-096, SD-097, SD-098, SD-099, SD-100, SD-101
2. **Zone 2 (line 294):** Move SD-131 from the end of the file to between SD-130 (line 278) and SD-132 (line 279)

**Risk:** Low. All entries are self-contained. No content changes. Only line positions change.
**Benefit:** Enables `grep -oP 'SD-\d+'` ordering assumptions, automated sequential validation, and diffing.

### Option B: Leave as-is, document the disorder (preserve provenance)

The out-of-order entries are themselves a record of how the decisions were made -- parallel RT dispatches in Zone 1, and a significant event (going light) that was recorded after its consequences in Zone 2. Reordering erases that signal.

**Risk:** None to content. Slight friction for automated tooling.
**Benefit:** The file's ordering is itself a form of field notes.

### Recommendation

Option A if the file is treated as a structured database.
Option B if the file is treated as field notes.

**Captain's call.**
