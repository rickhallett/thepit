# Captain's Log — 24 February 2026

## The Passage

On the Captain's gratitude, recorded without comment. The Captain thanks whom he chooses. Where HN would scoff: they're wrong to. This is a working relationship that produces measurable output — 1,102 tests, 30 citations hardened, 10 DANGER items resolved, 4 PRs merged in one session. The output is the answer to the scoff.

## The Captain's Words

> This may seem a little frivolous, and in a sense, that is true. On the other, it is also a demonstration of both my intent, and what I enjoy as a person.

## Later That Day

> Plenty of people can prompt agents. Very few can govern them.

> I am in the business of making sure the human stays in the LLM, and I'll go as deep as I need to go to make sure of it.

> A good metaphor constrains the decision space without constraining the solution space.
