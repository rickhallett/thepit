## The Captain's Words (verbatim)

> Why am I uncertain if we have this?

> **Concept angle:** the world is in a fever pitch regarding agents and trust; increasing intelligence more doesn't matter at all without verification. That is the provenance layer. We have been treating this as our layer, but is it, really? Let's break it down. What have we actually built? We have built a mechanism that takes an 'agent's DNA', essentially a string, and hashes it on a blockchain. Pretty cool for a solo dev, but it is blockchain 101. If the issue of trust could be solved by placing a string inside a block, the world would have done that before we woke up. The stink on the planet at the moment pertains to trusting the model providers, as well as trusting AI in general (Lying With Truth, gets worse the more intelligent the model is). That's two points of critical fail that could be directly beneath the hull.

> **HN:** "So the fuck what? This is a clown circus of agents that you can prove was minted to a user at a place in time and space. It solves nothing other than that; how does that trust then propagate through what the agent *says* and *does*? Sure, someone can attest on chain, but my sense is that agentic systems and the various harnesses around them are going to become rapidly developed at big tech level scale. How does our seed of trust propagate through all those layers?"

## The Core Questions

1. **Is the provenance layer actually our moat, or is it blockchain 101?** Hashing a string to a block is not novel. What is novel, if anything?

2. **Two critical failure points beneath the hull:**
   - Trusting model providers (they control the models, they can change behavior)
   - Trusting AI in general (Lying With Truth — gets worse with intelligence)

3. **Trust propagation:** How does identity at mint time connect to behavior at runtime? Proving who made an agent is not the same as proving what the agent will do.

4. **Scale defense:** Big tech will build harnesses rapidly. How does our seed of trust survive in their ecosystems?

5. **The "so what" test:** Can an HN commenter dismiss this in one sentence? If yes, we don't have it.

## RT Layer 1 Tasked

Weaver, Analyst, Architect, Sentinel to address. Honest answers only. SD-073 (Lying With Truth = Category One hazard) governs all responses.
