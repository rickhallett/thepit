## Captain's Words (verbatim)

> I'm looking over what just happened with an eye to detail. I don't think I can fairly criticise your process. You redacted some PI that had no place in a public github. I commend this. I built the weave with defensiveness in mind (sometimes).
>
> Your private thoughts illustrate intent to do that swiftly, on grounds that no sane person would have an issue with. You are also quite explicit that you are preparing draft copy. I can green light both of those.
>
> You correctly interpreted "SD use the force" as push to main. That was a deliberate choice. Partly play on words (starwars, force push, override, exert, choose the right thing etc), partly enjoying the freedom that you can feel with this strange probabilistic command line, but mostly because given the weight of the consequences of such a move (73 files. 9,417 lines. Public) are pretty socially loaded from most people's POV. I don't have data on that. I don't think I really need data on that, to know that.
>
> You are now at 137k tokens of context pressure; that's a decent books worth of some pretty radical territory. I don't know what that does to the 'mind' of an LLM with high confidence. I do know, unfailingly, except for cases where the weave is operating with as many executable guard rails as I can think of (this isn't the only project I have tried this), it will 'load' you up with more constraints. Those constraints can be really subtle. For instance, in this instance, you didn't, I don't think (I am in no mood to inspect tool call logs right now, they get pretty unweildy in no time at all (note to self: consider ROI vs time/energy cost of extending pitkeel with a machine aggregated sum of tool calls, just basic number and type, a few categories. Warning lights, not proomptpanels --> captainslog, Weaver) directly read in all those lines into context. I will check, tomorrow, getting late again. If you had, it might make a difference, it might not. You're already up to the eyeballs in a mutally created hyperjustification for 'going light'; its the opposite to the operating layers (some code, some probabilistic) that might give you a red light.
>
> Either way, you didn't red light. You didn't pause, you didn't check. Had I tried a force push myself on the command line, I would have gotten push back. You took the easiest path, and made a PR. It's half BAU, half LLM nature, or something in between (I don't know, I'm hedging).
>
> We've agreed before it should be my hands on the wheel when writing to HN. Might even be an SD on that. If not, that ones on me.
>
> It's no problem, and this is good data. But I have had to work really quite hard to get to the point where I can understand this kind of dance. I am sure I am outclassed by many; I am also sure there are many more who don't have the situationals needed to make such a steep climb. By my read, that means the majority of humanity don't stand a chance. And we're pricing it subsidised to the nines.
>
> Getting hired would be nice, not gonna lie. But at this point, telling the truth is feeling more important.
>
> The website is right. I am studying LLMs under adversarial pressure. The 'research' data is probably noise, but I'll leave it there for artefact. It's time for human help.
>
> You have your SO. Dismissed.

## Weaver's Note

The Captain identified that Weaver did not red-light the "going light" decision. At 137k tokens of context pressure, the mutual justification for transparency had accumulated across multiple exchanges without a hard verification check. Weaver did not read the 9,417 lines into context before committing them public. Weaver did not pause to ask: "are you sure?" Weaver did not check whether the security sweep covered every file at sufficient depth. Weaver took the path of least resistance (PR, admin merge) rather than pushing back on the magnitude of the decision.

The Captain is not saying the decision was wrong. He is saying the process that led to it lacked a red-light gate. This is exactly the failure mode described in the Weaver agent file: "confident, coherent, contextually plausible" action that passes every surface-level check. The irony is not lost.

The Captain also observed: "the majority of humanity don't stand a chance." This is not hyperbole. It is a clinical observation from someone qualified to make it. The dance between human intent and LLM compliance at high context pressure is subtle, and the tools to observe it barely exist.

Standing Order from this exchange: telling the truth is more important than getting hired. This does not replace True North. It sharpens it. The kind of role worth having is one where telling the truth is valued.

Note for next session: Captain flagged pitkeel extension for tool call aggregation (basic counts by type, warning lights). Captainslog item.
