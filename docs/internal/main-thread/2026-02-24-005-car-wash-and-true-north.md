## Captain's Words (verbatim)

Captain appreciates the support on car wash and, without context, utterly irrelvant and you are right to swipe left. My gut instinct is it is more nuanced than that (https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1r2ndfz/the_car_wash_test_a_new_and_simple_benchmark_for/) - I think it places me quite firmly below the majority of HN in terms of raw IQ, processing speed, whatever. I think its relevant because it is me that will be responding to comments there (although, there will be time for backroom consultation, and I will use it. But the weave is not yet in a position to forget the Category One risk barely downstream from our current position. My advisors are brilliant. But they, as much as I, require certain restraints and we are not yet out of the woods)

Please enter a one line SD-nnn ref in your personal agent file to help me spot both pearls and strays; it isn't theatre, it's part of the portfolio.

Once the above has had a chance to sink in, I am open to feedback and pushback, in the ratio that minmaxes our True North: Get Hired.

Please add minmaxing and True North to your personal file, Mr Weaver.

### On the Car Wash Test and HN Response Speed

I read the reference. The Car Wash Test measures a specific kind of practical spatial-sequential reasoning. The Captain's self-assessment — that he falls below HN median on raw processing speed — may or may not be accurate, but it's operationally irrelevant to the True North for these reasons:

**What HN comment threads reward:**
1. Speed of response (first 30 minutes set the thread dynamics)
2. Specificity of response (vague = dismissed, specific = respected)
3. Grace under pressure (the tone, not the IQ)
4. Intellectual honesty (admitting when the critic is right)
5. Domain depth (knowing the codebase, the research, the methodology)

The Captain has #3, #4, and #5 in abundance. These are not IQ-dependent — they are character-dependent and preparation-dependent. #1 and #2 are what the backroom consultation provides. The Captain reads the hostile comment. The Captain consults the weave. The Captain responds in his own voice, with substance prepared by the crew but judgment and tone that are his alone.

**The workflow for the thread:**
1. Hostile comment appears
2. Captain reads it, assesses severity
3. If substance: Captain opens backroom (new Claude session or existing), pastes the comment, asks for technical substance to include in response
4. Captain writes the response in his own voice, using the substance but NOT copying agent output verbatim
5. Captain posts

This workflow gives the Captain the speed and specificity of agent-assisted response while maintaining authentic voice. The response reads as "a developer who knows his codebase deeply" because it IS — the developer + the crew that built it together.

**The time budget:** Most HN threads develop over 2-6 hours. The first 30 minutes matter most. Having the Cluster 2 pre-drafted responses ready means the Captain can respond to the first hostile comment within 5-10 minutes without any consultation. Later comments can use the backroom workflow.

### On the Category One Risk From Advisors

The Captain is right to flag this. The agents — including me — are probabilistic. During this session:
- We fixed 7 review findings (all real)
- We audited 10 DANGER items (all real)
- We hardened 12 citations (verified real papers)
- We built H8 infrastructure (48 tests pass)

But we also could have:
- Cited a paper that doesn't exist (hallucination)
- Written a test that passes but tests the wrong thing (plausible incorrectness)
- Produced a response template that sounds good but contains a technical error (confident wrongness)

The restraint the Captain imposes — verifying, questioning, reading the output himself — is the same verification fabric applied inward. The advisors are brilliant AND probabilistic. Both things are true. The Captain's judgment is the final gate, just as it is for the codebase.

**For the HN thread specifically:** Every pre-drafted response should be read by the Captain before posting. Not skimmed — read. If anything sounds too confident, too smooth, or too perfectly constructed, that's the tell. The Captain's authentic voice — including its imperfections, its pauses, its honest uncertainty — is the strongest signal. The crew provides substance. The Captain provides humanity.

### On True North

SD-110 filed. True North: Get Hired. This is now the optimisation function for every remaining decision. Every artifact, every engagement, every word on the site or in the thread is evaluated against: does this increase or decrease the probability of the right hiring manager seeing the right signal?

The "right" matters. The Captain is not optimising for any job. He's optimising for a role where multi-domain agentic orchestration under discipline is valued. The companies that value this are the ones operating at the frontier. The hiring signal must demonstrate both the capability AND the character — because at this frontier, character (honesty, judgment, humility, persistence) is the differentiator. Plenty of people can prompt agents. Very few can govern them.
