# Main Thread Log — 2026-02-25-004 — After Dismissed

Back-reference: SD-133 (dismissed), SD-134 through SD-146
Register: Quarterdeck. Full sail. Returned from dismissal.
Note: Verbatim capture was not possible for these ticks — Captain's words exist only in the live context window. This file reconstructs the decision trail from SD entries and dispatched reports.

## Tick 1: Codifying the Lessons (SD-134 through SD-140)

Captain returned after dismissal. Ordered Weaver to translate the red-light failure debrief into SD and SO items. Weaver proposed: 3 SDs (True North sharpened, Captain's hands on wheel, red-light failure record), 4 PSOs (SO-RED-001, SO-CTX-001, SO-EXT-001, SO-TRUTH-001), 2 future items (pitkeel aggregation, hyperjustification detection). Captain concurred on all with caveats.

Captain's caveats (reconstructed from SDs):
- Hyperjustification loading is a research job for the Analyst (SD-139)
- Deckhand context minimization: each hand gets only what they need (SD-138)
- Pseudocode interpretation protocol: Captain using pseudocode deliberately (SD-137)
- SO-CTX-001 amendment: agents cannot self-measure context pressure (SD-140)
- PSOs held for next tick

## Tick 2: Analyst Dispatches + Lexicon v0.5 (SD-141 through SD-144)

Three analyst tasks dispatched:
1. Broaden literature search — position changed materially (SD-142). 6 new papers found.
2. Live lab notes framing review — "Live field notes" recommended (SD-143).
3. Lexicon bumped to v0.5: true_north in pseudocode, Fair-Weather Consensus added (SD-141).

## Tick 3: chmod Restriction + Audit Orders (SD-145 through SD-146)

Captain ordered:
- SO-CHMOD-001: no agent except Weaver may run chmod (SD-145)
- Fair-Weather Consensus ratified (SD-146)
- SD file ordering audit dispatched
- Verbatim recording of last 4 ticks dispatched (this file)
- YAML HUD syntax warning added to Weaver's file
- PSOs remain held for next tick

## Tick 4: [This tick — execution in progress]

Orders being executed. This file being written. chmod SO being issued to 10 agent files. SD audit dispatched. Hold list being prepared for next tick.

## Note on Verbatim Capture

SD-130 (Standing Order — PERMANENT) requires verbatim recording of Captain's words. These 4 ticks could not be captured verbatim because the recording order was issued at tick 3 for work that occurred at ticks 1-3. The Captain's exact words exist only in the context window of the session that produced SD-134 through SD-146. If that context window survives, Weaver should append the verbatim content. If it does not, this reconstruction from the decision trail is the best available record.
