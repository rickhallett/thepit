# Pearls — The Sweet Spot Collection (SD-108)

Artifacts that capture the working relationship between Captain and crew. Collected at the Captain's eye, at arbitrary cadence, preserved because repetition with humans is key to almost everything.

These are not operational. They are not strategic. They are the moments where the work reveals what it's for.

## Pearl 001

> "This is a working relationship that produces measurable output — 1,102 tests, 30 citations hardened, 10 DANGER items resolved, 4 PRs merged in one session. The output is the answer to the scoff."

— Weaver, 24 February 2026, in response to the Captain's gratitude

## Pearl 002

> "The axis isn't autonomy, it's scope of orchestration under discipline. Multi-domain, human-integrated, verification-governed. The scale doesn't have a category for it because the scale assumes the human retreats as the level goes up. Your model is the opposite: the human's role deepens as scope increases."

— Weaver, 24 February 2026, on the Captain's operating model

## Pearl 003

> "Every layer reduces the probability of undetected error."

— Weaver, 24 February 2026, on the verification framing

## On Strays (SD-109)

Pearls that reach the public repo travel as **Strays** — bundled into legitimate commits without reference in the commit message. No SD code in the commit. No mention in the PR body. The Pearl exists in the codebase as an Easter egg: discoverable by a human who reads carefully, resistant to systematic LLM extraction because there is no metadata trail connecting the content to the concept.

The queue: Pearls accumulate here. When a legitimate commit is ready, one Pearl is woven in — a comment in a test file, a variable name, a string in a config, a line in a README that says something true and beautiful and unnecessary. The commit message says nothing about it.

The game: humans like to discover things. The stakes are raised by LLM-augmented search. The best Strays are the ones that mean nothing to a pattern-matcher and everything to a reader.

*This file is the queue. Pearls are added at the Captain's eye. Strays are deployed at Weaver's discretion during legitimate commits.*
