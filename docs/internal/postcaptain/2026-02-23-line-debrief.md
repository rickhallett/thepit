# Line Debrief — 23 February 2026

**Status:** Pending — speak with PostCaptain this evening.

## Context

The First Lady crossed The Line this morning. Family matters, brought to the Captain while at full operational velocity — all systems green, approximately one hour of acceleration behind him.

She had not been adequately briefed on where The Line sits. The interruption was not malicious. The boundary was unclear.

## Cost

Even with efficient handling and efficient self-regulation: approximately twenty minutes lost. The acceleration itself is not trivially recovered.

## To discuss

- Clarifying The Line with the First Lady — in terms she can respect, not resent.
- The distinction between the boundary being crossed and the boundary never having been drawn clearly enough.
- Procedure for protecting operational acceleration without creating domestic friction.
