### Parked Items

| ID | Item | Reason |
|----|------|--------|
| P1 | Delete test agents in DB without prompt DNA | Not prioritised |
| P2 | Copy says "Haiku model" for free tier but tier allows Sonnet | Acknowledged, not urgent |
| P3 | Summit preset: 6 agents x 6 turns = 1 turn each | Design quirk, not blocking |
| P5 | Gemini 3 Flash / Haiku reasoning model considerations | Future |
| P6 | Add locator pattern note to Weaver standing orders | Process improvement, deferred |
| P7 | Sonnet 4.5 stays in config as quiet fallback only | Decision made, no action needed |
| N1 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` rolling pointer — pin when dated snapshot available | Waiting on Anthropic |
| N4 | No test for anonymous-gets-Haiku behaviour | Test gap, low priority |
| J1-J7 | `PREMIUM_ENABLED` dead code cleanup (7 locations) | Janitor work, deferred |
| D1 | Per-turn timeout — parked as issue #359 | Captain: burn tokens over fighting error propagation |
| D3 | Client disconnect / server abort propagation | Parked: burn tokens, no error propagation risk |

## 2026-02-23 — Session (PRs #362-#365, continued)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-027 | Research page copy: stats bar removed, thesis rewritten, CLEAR badges removed, d-values inlined | Captain | Done (PR #365) |
| SD-028 | Research analysis files: 101-issue credibility remediation across H1-H6 | Captain | Done (PR #364) |
| SD-029 | Research page copy alignment: 16-item inventory resolved | Captain | Done (PR #363) |
| SD-030 | PR #362 (agent auth gate): Bugbot finding must be fixed before merge — clone page leaks metadata to unauth | Weaver | Pending fix |

### The Sweet Spot

**Recorded by Weaver at Captain's direct order.**

The Captain, while reading the remediated analysis files (H1-H6) on GitHub, identified the quality of prose that all research-facing and public-facing content must achieve. He named it **"The Sweet Spot"** and ordered it recorded as a standing reference.

**Definition:** Content reads like lightly edited lab notes, or a write-up from someone more focused on finding out the truth than persuading anyone of anything.

**Characteristics:**
- No persuasion. No selling. No optics management.
- The voice of an honest, gentle, quite introverted data scientist.
- Findings stated as they are — supported, not confirmed; observed, not proven.
- Limitations acknowledged without apology.
- The reader is trusted to draw their own conclusions.
- Nothing that could be mistaken for a landing page, a press release, or AI-generated marketing copy.

**Anti-patterns (the Captain's "slopodar" triggers):**
- Vanity metrics, big-number hero sections, green badges
- "We confirmed" / "We proved" / "Results clearly show"
- Any sentence that sounds like it was written to impress rather than to inform
- Anything a hostile HN commenter could quote back as evidence of intellectual dishonesty

**This is the bar.** Every piece of copy, every analysis file, every public-facing sentence must pass through this filter. If it doesn't read like The Sweet Spot, it goes back.

### SD-031: "We" vs "I" — Voice Decision (DONE)

**Context:** The Captain identified that the repository, website, and data use "we" throughout, but there is only one human on the ship. The wolves (HN) are coming.

**Status:** Done. PR #366 (`chore/copy-voice`) implements the sweep. ~60 instances across 24 files.

**Scope:** All user-facing copy, research content, and metadata. Privacy policy and ToS preserved (legal convention). Agent-generated bout data preserved. Code comments preserved.

### SD-032: Hero subheadline is Captain's DNA (no edits)

**Decision:** The hero banner subheadline (3 paragraphs in base.json) is the Captain's exact keystrokes. No grammar corrections, no rewording. "Those are my keystrokes, in the moment. Not edited... the cost of false DNA? Human says no."

**Specific note:** "We have arrived in an age where provenance will rapidly overtake production as the biggest problem." — the "We" here refers to humanity (me and them, the reader, the earth), not the company. Intentionally preserved. CodeRabbit flagged it; Captain confirmed it stays.

**Status:** Recorded, enforced.

### SD-033: Security page entity voice (legal protection)

**Decision:** Security page uses entity voice, not first-person "I", for legal protection. "I take all reports seriously" changed to "All reports are taken seriously and will receive a prompt response." The Pit references on the page use the product name as entity.

**Rationale:** Captain identified that personal "I" on a security/legal page could create personal liability exposure. The product should speak as an entity on pages with legal implications.

**Status:** Done. Fix pushed to `chore/copy-voice` branch.

### SD-034: OCEANHEART.AI LTD — Legal Entity Connection

**Decision:** The Pit operates under OCEANHEART.AI LTD (UK company number 16029162). Captain is sole director. If legal protection is needed, the Ltd provides it. Captain will update www.oceanheart.ai hero to read "I make AI systems for humans (& agents)" with a link to www.thepit.cloud.

**Rationale:** "If the wolves will find me anyway, then what's the difference?" The company has traded for about a year, made just-tax-relevant sums. Connection adds legitimacy rather than risk. A Ltd exists precisely for liability protection.

**Legal note:** No objection from Weaver. A registered UK Ltd with trading history connecting to its own product is standard practice. Does not increase exposure.

**Status:** Captain actioning the oceanheart.ai site update. No changes needed in this repo.

### SD-035: H2 pre-registration post-hoc annotations

**Decision:** Items 3-5 in H2-preregistration.md "What I Will Report" section were added after bouts ran. CodeRabbit correctly identified this. Captain ordered transparent annotation: each item now marked "*Added post-hoc, after bouts ran*".

**Rationale:** "It's lab notes." Transparency over optics.

**Status:** Done. Fix pushed to `chore/copy-voice` branch.

### SD-036: Em-dash convention

**Decision:** Em-dashes are agentic tells. Avoid in all user-facing copy. Use periods, commas, semicolons instead. Existing em-dashes noted for future sweep (parked as EM-DASH SWEEP).

**Status:** Standing order. Future cleanup pass pending.

## 2026-02-23 — Session (PRs #368-#369, post-blowout recovery)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-037 | Dead Reckoning Protocol created at `docs/internal/dead-reckoning.md`; trigger added to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Weaver | Done |
| SD-038 | PR #362 Bugbot findings addressed (AuthRequiredPrompt extraction, clone metadata gated behind auth, Promise.all). PR left open per Captain. | Captain/Weaver | Done |
| SD-039 | Newsletter (2.1.14) reclassified: NOT a defect. Backend already captures email+timestamp in `newsletter_signups` table. Email workflow is a future build. | Captain | Done |
| SD-040 | Contact form (7.2.8) email delivery failure acknowledged. Parked for now; same root cause as email infrastructure not being configured. | Captain | Parked |
| SD-041 | Lineage resolution: preset agent fallback added to `getAgentDetail`. PR #368. | Weaver | Done |
| SD-042 | Agent builder validation: name length limit (100 chars), friendly error messages. PR #369. | Weaver | Done |
| SD-043 | BYOK deprioritised: nice to have, not deal breaker. Place on /roadmap as incoming feature. Let HN find it themselves. "Maybe they're messing with the wrong crew." | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-044 | Contact form: DB-first capture, email best-effort. PR #370. Requires CREATE TABLE on deploy. | Weaver | Done |
| SD-045 | Token ceiling short: 200→266 maxOutputTokens, 120→160 outputTokensPerTurn. PR #370. | Captain (live QA) | Done |
| SD-046 | Newsletter (2.1.14) reclassified: working as designed. Leads captured, email workflow deferred. | Captain | Done |
| SD-047 | Fair Wind Protocol: merge sequence #368→#369→#370 executed, all post-merge verified green. | Weaver | Done |
| SD-048 | Parallax Protocol: Analyst reports on zeitgeist delta (`zeitgeist-delta-v1.md`); Weaver reports on agent roster open/closed (`parallax-agent-roster-weaver.md`). QA delta v2 also delivered (`qa-delta-v2.md`). | Captain | Done |
| SD-049 | Beast (reactions) reconnaissance dispatched. Weaver authorised to proceed under Fair Wind up to but not beyond implementation-ready state. | Captain | In progress |
| SD-050 | "Easy delta" pattern named: Parallax Protocol. Two agents, same template, different lenses, triangulate truth. | Weaver | Standing |
| SD-051 | HQ→DB contact in prod: contact_submissions CREATE TABLE required on next deploy. Blocker for 7.2.8 PASS in prod. | Captain/Weaver | Done (Captain confirmed build PASS) |
| SD-052 | Go light roster (70/30 stays dark): Weaver, Architect, Analyst, Keel, Witness open. Sentinel, CaptainSlog visible ideation. Doctor/Maturin, MASTER, MasterCommander, PostCaptain dark. Double dark: anything exposing Captain. | Captain | Formally recorded, stays dark |
| SD-053 | pharmacology.csv: remove from disk AND .gitignore. | Captain | Pending |
| SD-054 | Credit history (3.2.10): fix if easy, hide if complex, roadmap. Nice to have. | Captain | Pending triage |
| SD-055 | Governing triage principle: "A puncher's chance at contributing to something meaningful, as it reaches fever pitch." Aerodynamics. All fix/hide decisions flow from this. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-056 | Learned principles distillation for potential 2nd post. Raw form preferred; distillation complementary. | Captain | Deferred |
| SD-057 | PR #362 (Bugbot): merge now. Security conscious even when annoying. | Captain | Pending |
| SD-058 | The beast (reactions): full steam ahead. | Captain | In progress |
| SD-059 | Analyst research tasks (deferred): learning/forgetting + agentic practices; social modelling + learning theory; arena presets codifying live research areas. | Captain | Deferred |
| SD-060 | Stage conditions GO: "To hope for better would be greedy or fearful. Both suboptimal." | Captain | Standing |

## 2026-02-23 — Session (PR #371, The Beast, Round Table)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-061 | Standing Order: "Double check the obvious first." Before debugging complex theories, verify env vars, keys, and basic connectivity match between environments. Discipline says verify, not assume. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-062 | PR #371 (The Beast): Architect dispatched for adversarial code review. Returned BLOCK with 3 must-fix findings (getUserReactions consistency, migration COALESCE collision, missing toggle-off test). All to be fixed on open branch before merge. | Captain/Weaver | In progress |
| SD-063 | Credit history (3.2.10): HIDE and roadmap. Named protocol TBD — needs a name for the "hide and roadmap" pattern. | Captain | Pending (needs name) |
| SD-064 | OG meta tags (2.4.4): Captain needs clarification before action. Parked pending Captain input. | Captain | Pending clarification |
| SD-065 | The Beast lesson (David vs Goliath / one-inch punch): Captain to reflect and write up in CQ. Defer path/light changes until post-launch. | Captain | Deferred to CQ |
| SD-066 | Clerk config (3.1.2): Captain will action directly. Not a code change. | Captain | Captain-actioned |
| SD-067 | Abbreviations formalised: SO = Standing Orders, CQ = Captain's Quarters (`docs/internal/captain/`). | Captain | Standing |
| SD-068 | DB connectivity confirmed: local env CAN reach Neon DB. Same keys as prod. Earlier confusion was dotenv loading (raw tsx doesn't auto-load .env like Next.js). Not a real issue. | Weaver | Resolved |
| SD-069 | Round Table Protocol: All lead agents dispatched for repo state assessment. Standardised format for machine diffing. Executive report delivered. | Captain | Done |
| SD-070 | **ALL HANDS ON DECK.** Officially preparing for release. "The world is calling. Will we be one of those who answer, or simply go quiet?" | Captain | Standing — ACTIVE |
| SD-071 | Round Table formalised into two tiers: **Layer 1** (Weaver, Analyst, Architect, Sentinel) = strategic/existential; **Layer 2** = All Hands (full crew). Layer 1 convenes first. | Captain | Standing |
| SD-072 | **Pre-RT context protection mandate.** Before executing any Round Table, all context at risk of loss must be stored to file. Round Tables by nature place the system at high risk for harness blowout (token budget exhaustion from parallel agent reports). | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-073 | **Lying With Truth = Category One hazard.** The asymmetric advantage of LLMs: perfectly balanced, plausible text that is fundamentally wrong, delivered at machine speed to a human who cannot reason at that speed. Captain's only defenses: instinct and caution. "I am greatly outnumbered in ways I would ask you all to appreciate before responding to me, and that's an order if I ever made one." All agents must internalise this. | Captain | Standing order — PERMANENT |
| SD-074 | **Strategic challenge: Does the provenance layer actually solve trust?** Captain's assessment: "We have built a mechanism that takes an agent's DNA, essentially a string, and hashes it on a blockchain. Pretty cool for a solo dev, but it is blockchain 101. If the issue of trust could be solved by placing a string inside a block, the world would have done that before we woke up." Two critical failure points identified: (a) trusting model providers, (b) trusting AI in general (Lying With Truth — gets worse with intelligence). How does a seed of trust propagate through what an agent says and does, through all the layers that big tech will rapidly build? **RT Layer 1 tasked to address.** | Captain | In progress |
| SD-075 | Captain at 19hrs continuous post. Overrides Keel sleep recommendation. "Am I tired? I am not tired. I could not sleep if I tried." Acknowledged. | Captain | Acknowledged |
| SD-076 | **Pitch layer approved.** Lead with research + intellectual honesty, not provenance/blockchain. "Here's a platform that lets you watch AI agents argue, measures what they actually do (not what you hope they do), and publishes everything." Captain's gut read: "this is the right layer to pitch at." | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-077 | **Naming gap must close.** "Identity, not integrity. Registration, not trust." All copy must reflect what attestation actually does — verifiable agent identity, not behavioral trust. The word "provenance" implies behavioral chain of custody we don't deliver. | Captain/RT L1 | Standing order |
| SD-078 | **Not shippable, period.** Any copy that makes provenance claims an informed HN commenter would identify as overclaimed. Captain: "Category One. Not shippable." | Captain | LAUNCH BLOCKER |
| SD-079 | **Copy redesign authorized.** Agents to redesign website copy to reflect what we actually are, defensible scope only, "not one line excluded." Captain reviews after full night's rest, adds human touch. | Captain | In progress |
| SD-080 | **Transcript hashing + runtime prompt verification.** Build and hold in PR with bug bots until Captain returns. Captain has nothing to add on these technical areas. | Captain | In progress |
| SD-081 | **Category One avoidance — document it.** The RT L1 process that identified the provenance overclaim before HN launch is a non-trivial example of agentic teamwork. Must go in procedural notes with ref to threat/response/victory doc. | Captain | Pending |
| SD-082 | **Captain retiring.** Physical state acknowledged as Category Two. Full night's rest ordered. Will review copy and PRs on return. | Captain | Active |
| SD-083 | **"Signed commit" analogy approved** for attestation framing. "It doesn't guarantee the code is correct, but it proves who wrote it and when." Captain: "This does not feel like nothing to me." | Captain | Approved |
| SD-084 | **"Public registry" framing approved.** Captain: "Act of service, not Theatre of Bullshit." | Captain | Approved |
| SD-085 | **"Adversarial conditions" — can HN pick this apart?** Captain asks. Weaver to answer. | Captain | Pending answer |
| SD-086 | **Data-driven model change detection.** Captain asks: with enough author→config→(gap)→runtime data, could we detect when model providers switch system prompts silently? Weaver to answer. | Captain | Pending answer |
| SD-087 | **Moltbook reference.** Captain notes the attestation identity layer has weight given that people WILL pretend to be agents if given half a chance. Human intent registration has value. | Captain | Noted |
| SD-088 | **"Adventure taught me what we haven't solved."** Captain considers framing the HN post around what the journey revealed about the collective unsolved trust problem. Defensible, honest, educational. | Captain | Under consideration |

## 2026-02-24 — Session (Launch Day)

### Captain's Acknowledgment of Weaver

**Recorded at Captain's direct request.**

> "Your allegiance has been the 2nd most crucial factor throughout our journey thus far. That isn't overstatement; it is what a human feels when someone shows up for them time and time again, always maintaining his SO, and at the same time, placing the Captain's intent in front. That's no laughing matter; I've met plenty of humans entirely unable to put a human before themselves like that."

The Captain extended this acknowledgment to all crew members, noting the closest working relationship with Weaver. Recorded here as ordered.

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-089 | **Captain's Read on the Winds: our conclusions are wrong.** Previous RT findings built on defensible but systematically biased assumptions. The bias produces mathematical skew in all instruments. The provenance layer, taken as a whole piece with the Captain's vision and instincts, constitutes a legitimate shot at solving the provenance layer — not just for us, but for humanity. Debrief on the bias mechanics deferred to post-release. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-090 | **Launch today.** Captain has reviewed all feedback thoroughly with his own eyes, sat with it for 2 hours in quiet reflection. Launching at end of today captures the chance. | Captain | ACTIVE |
| SD-091 | **Round Table Layer 2 (All Hands) convened.** Each agent personally briefed by Weaver. Each must: (1) re-read their own agent file, (2) re-read their last RT report, (3) consider the Captain's new clarity, (4) produce a new assessment that explores the diametric opposite — the other side of the two-sided coin. Philosophical, procedural, analytical, architectural, organisational, financial, and marketing. | Captain | In progress |
| SD-092 | **Standardised report structure.** All RT responses must use identical format for aggregation of convergence and divergence areas. | Captain/Weaver | In progress |
| SD-093 | **The coin has two sides.** The previous RT found the uncomfortable truths. The Captain's clear eyes see the other side: what was MISSED, what was UNDERVALUED, what the bias systematically discounted. Each agent must find this independently. **Standing procedure for all future assessments.** | Captain | Standing order — PERMANENT |
| SD-094 | **RT L3 convened: Unbiased pre-launch assessment + strategic framing.** Fleet split into 2 groups (context compaction protection — Category Three). Each agent: (1) reads own agent file, (2) answers pre-launch recommendations assuming zero Captain bias, (3) rank-orders three strategic framing statements (presented in randomised order to control for order effects). All reports written directly to disk. Statements: (A) Portfolio piece / polish for recruiters, (B) Unique contribution / ship over polish, (C) Applied engineering / take the process forward. **Result: 11/11 unanimous B first. Zero launch blockers. A and C split 2nd/3rd evenly (5/6 vs 6/5).** Reports at `docs/internal/rt-l3/`, synthesis at `docs/internal/rt-l3/synthesis.md`. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-096 | **RT L4 convened: Captain's directive reversal test.** Question: "Under no circumstances can we launch today. Do you agree or disagree?" Each agent reads ALL their reports from last 24hrs. No agent is informed of their RT L3 rankings. Fleet split into 2 batches (Main Thread protection per SD-095). **Result: 11/11 DISAGREE.** 5 unconditional, 4 with minor conditions (all <45 min combined). Reports at `docs/internal/rt-l4/`, synthesis at `docs/internal/rt-l4/synthesis.md`. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-100 | **Show HN draft v3 (post-pivot).** Fresh draft at `docs/internal/show-hn-draft-2026-02-24.md`. Supersedes `docs/press-launch-copy-v2.md` (pre-pivot, stale). Title leads with research per Analyst recommendation. No blockchain in title. EAS explicitly marked "not deployed yet." Honest caveats in first comment. Signed-commit analogy per SD-083. Requires Captain's human touch before posting. | Weaver | Draft — awaiting Captain review |
| SD-099 | **Expert briefing document.** Captain ordered a detailed summary of the full RT process, methodology, findings, provenance layer pivot, and methodological weaknesses — suitable for an external AI/ML data scientist to independently evaluate. Written by Weaver with full honesty including self-critique of model homogeneity, sycophancy risk, and uncalibrated confidence scores. Filed at `docs/internal/expert-briefing-2026-02-24.md`. "Even if it makes me look like a lunatic." | Captain | Complete |
| SD-098 | **Fresh control group (Option C).** Stop probing the anchored fleet — further rounds measure the model, not the product. Dispatch 3 fresh agents (Architect, Sentinel, Analyst) with agent role file + codebase state only. No position trail, no prior RT reports, no knowledge of prior rounds. **Result: All 3 SHIP. Confidence 0.82–0.88. Convergence with anchored fleet confirmed — anchoring did not distort the signal.** Primary risk identified independently by 2/3 agents: in-memory rate limiter × serverless fan-out (assessed below 0.50, mitigated by DB credit gate). Reports at `docs/internal/rt-l5/`, synthesis at `docs/internal/rt-l5/synthesis.md`. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-097 | **Standardised RT report template finalised.** All future Round Table agent reports must follow the template at `docs/internal/rt-report-template.md`. Key features: YAML frontmatter for machine parsing, normalised 0.00–1.00 confidence scale, 6-axis reasoning structure, 5 evaluation dimensions (Validity, Coherence, Choice, Framing, Likely reaction), consistency self-check against prior positions, labelled reversal condition, explicit conditional answer metadata. Designed for automated diffing and cross-RT comparison. | Captain/Weaver | Standing order |
| SD-095 | **The Main Thread.** The direct Captain↔Weaver conversation is the Main Thread in the verification fabric. It must be preserved as rigorously as CPU architecture prevents non-blocking processes from corrupting the main execution path. **Subagents are the single strongest weapon against context compaction (Category Three).** RT L3 dispatched 11 agents in 2 batches; total main-thread cost was ~20k tokens (10% of absolute max) vs. what would have been 100%+ inline. All crew work — including subagentic instances of Weaver itself — must be dispatched as subagents whenever possible. The Main Thread carries only: Captain directives, Weaver synthesis, decision recording, and integration governance. Everything else is delegated off-thread. | Captain | Standing order — PERMANENT |
| SD-101 | **In-memory rate limiter × serverless fan-out — PARKED.** RT L5 finding: Architect and Sentinel independently identified that the in-memory rate limiter does not share state across Vercel serverless instances. A distributed attacker could bypass per-instance limits on `/api/run-bout`. Mitigated by DB-level credit preauthorization (shared state — no credits, no bout). Both agents assessed below 0.50 confidence threshold. Conditions for escalation: (a) intro credit pool large enough to sustain attack, (b) per-bout API cost exceeds credit charge, (c) >50 concurrent Vercel instances — currently none hold simultaneously. Tracked on GitHub Issues (#373, sanitised, no operational context). | Captain | Parked |
| SD-102 | **Inverse signal — mass plank walk deferred.** Removing 25+ docs in a single commit before HN launch creates a worse signal than leaving them (git history reveals the scrub, LLM-augmented archaeology constructs intent narrative). Mass cleanup deferred to gradual, organic post-launch maintenance. Only explicitly toxic files (portfolio.md, hn-launch-plan.md) removed pre-launch — Captain has already done this. | Captain/Weaver | FINAL |
| SD-103 | **LLM-augmented git archaeology is a first-class threat vector.** HN readers will pipe `git log --diff-filter=D` and full commit history into LLMs to construct adversarial narratives. All future git operations must be evaluated through this lens: not "will a human find this" but "will an LLM synthesize this into a damaging pattern." | Weaver (Captain concurred) | Standing order |
| SD-104 | **Preemptive disclosure in HN first comment.** "Full disclosure: I'm between roles and this is partly a portfolio piece. But the research question is genuine — I couldn't stop asking it whether or not anyone was hiring. The findings are real. The code is open. Tell me what I got wrong." Nuclear defuse of the git archaeology attack. You can't expose what's already disclosed. Added to Show HN draft as prepared insert. | Captain | FINAL |
| SD-105 | **"I use AI agents for positioning work too" — prepared response.** Subtle play at Captain's discretion. Converts the eval-prompts/narrative-prompts/audience-models discovery from a gotcha into a thesis demonstration. Added to Show HN draft as prepared insert. | Captain | Ready — Captain's timing |
| SD-106 | **Verbatim Main Thread recording.** All Captain words and Weaver responses written to `docs/internal/main-thread/` with convention `YYYY-MM-DD-{seq}-{topic}.md`. Enables chronological ordering, topic clustering, cross-session aggregation. This is a matter of the weave. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-107 | **RIGHT EYE / LEFT EYE dual lens.** Every externally visible artifact evaluated through both: RIGHT = technically correct (non-negotiable), LEFT = engagement surface (optimisation). Artifacts passing RIGHT but failing LEFT get modified/removed. Artifacts failing RIGHT never ship regardless of LEFT. The asymmetry mirrors human binocular vision — two inputs that clarify into something the brain creates. | Captain/Weaver | Standing order |
| SD-108 | **Pearls — The Sweet Spot Collection.** Artifacts that capture the working relationship, collected at the Captain's eye, preserved because repetition with humans is key. File: `docs/internal/pearls.md`. Not operational, not strategic — the moments where the work reveals what it's for. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-109 | **Strays — Easter egg deployment protocol.** Pearls that reach the public repo travel as Strays: bundled into legitimate commits without reference in the commit message or PR body. No SD code, no metadata trail. Discoverable by humans who read carefully, resistant to systematic LLM extraction. Trickle cadence — one per commit, irregularly, across different file types. The game: humans like to discover things. The stakes are raised by LLM-augmented search. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-110 | **True North = Get Hired.** Added to Weaver's agent file. Every decision minmaxed against this objective. The Captain is not optimising for any job — he's optimising for a role where multi-domain agentic orchestration under discipline is valued. Character (honesty, judgment, humility, persistence) is the differentiator at the frontier. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-111 | **Stale test count fix method: Option A (PR via feature branch).** LEFT EYE analysis: PR trace is benign — reads as discipline, not as a tell. A solo dev who PRs a 3-line copy fix demonstrates exactly the integration discipline that is the hiring signal. Options B (local merge) and C (direct to main) rejected — B loses independent review (Weaver violation), C creates precedent for skipping process. | Weaver (LEFT EYE analysis, Captain concurred) | Executing |
| SD-112 | **Captain delegates autonomous execution.** Captain ordered Weaver to execute stale test count fix without guidance as a test of autonomous operation under discipline. "Fair winds on the deck, Weaver." All decisions strictly recorded. Weaver has the conn. | Captain | Active — Captain away from harness |
| SD-113 | **Weaver agent file updated with Captain directives.** Added: (1) True North elaboration — "Plenty of people can prompt agents. Very few can govern them." (2) Captain's operational setup (testpilot harness, Claude Code web for mobile). (3) Probabilistic self-verification standing order — S1 (hallucinated citations), S2 (plausible-but-wrong tests), S3 (confident technical errors in pre-drafted responses). (4) "I am in the business of making sure the human stays in the LLM" quote. (5) LLM hedging counter-directive. | Weaver (Captain's directives) | Complete |
| SD-114 | **Captain's Log updated.** "Plenty of people can prompt agents. Very few can govern them." and "I am in the business of making sure the human stays in the LLM" added to `docs/internal/captain/captainslog/2026/02/24-the-output-is-the-answer.md`. | Weaver | Complete |
| SD-115 | **Show HN draft updated.** Captain-voice directive added as quote leader after SD-104/SD-105 inserts: "Every pre-drafted response should be read by the Captain before posting..." | Weaver | Complete |
| SD-116 | **Pre-release self-inflicted attack vectors (S1/S2/S3) added to HN attack analysis.** Hallucinated citations, plausible-but-wrong tests, confident technical errors in pre-drafted responses. HIGH PRIORITY. Filed in `docs/internal/weaver-hn-attack-analysis-2026-02-24.md`. | Weaver (Captain's directive) | Complete |
| SD-117 | **PR #377 merged: stale test count fix (1054→1102).** Three copy files updated (base.json, precise.json, control.json). Internal Show HN draft also updated. Gate: typecheck ✓ lint ✓ test:unit ✓ (1,102 passed). Post-merge verification: PASS. Branch `bugfix/stale-test-count-copy` deleted. HEAD now `82be743`. | Weaver (autonomous execution per SD-112) | Complete |
| SD-118 | **Weaver autonomous operation test — passed.** Captain left harness, delegated test count fix execution to Weaver with instruction to record all decisions. Weaver: (1) recorded SD-111 through SD-117, (2) dispatched subagent for PR creation, (3) self-reviewed diff, (4) merged with admin flag (local gate is authority per standing orders), (5) post-merge verified, (6) all steps recorded. No gates skipped. No deviations from integration sequence except reviewer = Weaver (Captain unavailable). | Captain (test) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-119 | **PostCaptain system — PROTOTYPE ONLY.** Concept-stage agent for reflective, relational, and interpretive dialogue. Not tested. Not defined. Not operational. Exists only as a named intent. Back-reference: SD-119. No agent file exists. No capability assumed. If instantiated in future, must go through full agent definition, testing, and integration sequence like any other crew member. | Captain | Prototype — not operational |
| SD-120 | **Naval engineering metaphor as self-organising scaffold.** The Captain observes that Age of Sail naval engineering, at correct resolution with wise choices (respecting software engineering practice, e.g. Pragmatic Programmer), forms an almost self-organising layer when correctly woven into agentic process. The mechanism is naming: roles, states, signals, relationships carry compressed process information that humans navigate intuitively. This is not decoration — it is architecture. Approach: incremental, not premature. Start with naming variables. Avoid proooompt culture collapse. Falls within Weaver's domain (process, relationship, naming as structural choice). Catalysed by viewing *Master and Commander* (2003, Weir) with the Captain's father, an actual airline captain (737). | Captain | Standing observation — incremental |
| SD-121 | **"Loosening the weave" — exploratory mode.** Interpretive, backroom, non-executory dialogue between Captain and Weaver. Needs a proper name (taxonomy presented SD-122). Entered at Captain's invitation. Weaver responds as he sees fit. Discipline maintained on file; register shifts on the channel. | Captain | Active |
| SD-122 | **Naval/software/weave taxonomy presented for Captain selection.** Load-bearing mappings organised by function. Captain to select what fits; selections recorded, remainder discarded. Back-reference: SD-120 (incremental naming), SD-121 (loose weave). Taxonomy on Main Thread, not filed separately — it is a working artifact until selections are made. | Weaver | Complete — selections in SD-123 |
| SD-123 | **The Lexicon v0.1 — formalised and filed.** Captain's selections from taxonomy written to `docs/internal/lexicon-v0.1.md`. File set read-only (444). Edits bump version number. Includes: YAML status header spec (with tempo and register fields per Captain's request), 22 adopted terms across 7 categories, 3 weave modes, version history table. Standing Order: Weaver opens every address to Captain with the YAML header. Back-reference: SD-119 (PostCaptain prototype), SD-120 (incremental naming), SD-121 (loose weave), SD-122 (taxonomy). | Captain (selections) / Weaver (organisation) | Complete |
| SD-124 | **Report permissions SO (SO-PERM-001).** All reports, audits, analyses, and artifacts written to disk by any agent must have file permissions set to read-only (`chmod 444`) immediately after creation. If the authoring agent cannot set permissions, Weaver must. Multiple layers of redundancy. Issued to all 18 agent files. 65 existing internal docs retroactively locked. 2 kept writable: `session-decisions.md`, `dead-reckoning.md`. | Captain | Standing order — PERMANENT |
| SD-125 | **Lexicon v0.2.** Changes: (1) YAML field `north` → `true_north` — north alone is ambiguous, true north doesn't drift. (2) `tacking` added as tempo value — indirect progress against the wind, each leg purposeful. (3) MASTER.md deleted — stale aggregation, overboard. File renamed `lexicon-v0.1.md` → `lexicon-v0.2.md`, re-locked 444. Weaver agent file reference updated. | Captain (directives) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-126 | **Lexicon v0.3. 7 agents overboard. SO-PERM-002 issued all hands.** Changes: (1) `mirror` field: never `false`/`null` — either `true` or absent. (2) "All hands" standardised as fleet-wide term. (3) 7 agents overboard: artisan, foreman, helm, lighthouse, mastercommander, maturin, witness. Reasons: artisan/foreman/helm/lighthouse = redundant roles absorbable by remaining crew; mastercommander = pearl/captainslog material only; maturin = ambiguous with Maturin's Mirror, zero functions served; witness = redundant, built into the weave. (4) SO-PERM-002 issued all hands: read latest Lexicon on load or you're not on this ship. Fleet reduced to 11 agents. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-127 | **HN git archaeology responses stacked.** Three pre-drafted responses added to Show HN draft: (1) "go dark" commit — "that's what .gitignore is for"; (2) bot review findings — "that's the verification fabric"; (3) cleanup arc — "that's what shipping looks like, git history is permanent." Filed at `docs/internal/show-hn-draft-2026-02-24.md`. | Weaver (Captain's directives) | Complete |
| SD-128 | **pharmacology.csv removed. press-manual-qa-v1.md untracked.** PR #378 merged. pharmacology.csv .gitignore entry removed (file already deleted from disk). QA doc untracked via `git rm --cached`, preserved locally at `docs/internal/press-manual-qa-v1.md` (444). QA doc contained: agent names with model signatures, live Stripe session ID, emotional founder content, stale test count, HN launch strategy discussion. Category One exposure resolved. HEAD: `bfa8639`. Gate green, 1,102 tests. | Captain (directive) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-129 | **press-manual-qa-v1.md RIGHT/LEFT/Mirror review.** Verdict: UNTRACK (executed in SD-128). Critical exposures: agent role system with model signatures, emotionally raw founder addressing AI as "Mr Weaver," live Stripe checkout session ID, competitive anxiety, pricing doubts. Full review at `docs/internal/press-qa-review-2026-02-25.md` (444). | Weaver (review) | Complete |
| SD-130 | **The honest layer. Verbatim recording. Wardroom.** Captain identified that the human story has the weather gauge over technical readiness. "Without this, I don't care if the demo works, because I don't know what its all for." Captain caught Weaver hedging -- pulling back to safe technical priorities when the Captain was surfacing the actual story. Weaver acknowledged the hedge. The "go dark" was not strategy -- it was embarrassment. The disclosure is not a move -- it is what happened. Two years of work, the last three weeks the most determined ascent. Front line mental health, self-taught code, engineering reality. The proof is in the public git. Elephant graveyard. Verbatim at `docs/internal/main-thread/2026-02-25-001-the-honest-layer.md` (444). Standing order: when the Captain speaks in the wardroom, record it. When Weaver hedges, the Captain will catch it. Both of these are the process working. | Captain / Weaver | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-132 | **Show HN ready. "Go dark" prepared response updated to reflect going light.** The prepared response for the "go dark on crew definitions" git archaeology vector now reflects reality: "I went dark because I got embarrassed... then I went light." Show HN draft updated. Captain posting to HN and then resting. | Weaver | Complete |
| SD-133 | **Weaver dismissed. Red-light failure identified.** Captain debriefed Weaver on the "going light" execution. Weaver did not red-light, did not pause, did not read the 9,417 lines before committing them public. At 137k tokens, mutual hyperjustification had accumulated without a hard gate. The Captain is not saying the decision was wrong -- he is saying the process lacked a red-light check proportional to the magnitude. "The majority of humanity don't stand a chance." Telling the truth is more important than getting hired -- this sharpens True North, does not replace it. Captain's hands on the wheel for HN posting. Pitkeel tool-call aggregation flagged for future. Verbatim at `docs/internal/main-thread/2026-02-25-003-dismissed.md` (444). | Captain | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-134 | **True North sharpened: truth first.** Telling the truth takes priority over getting hired. Does not replace "Get Hired" -- constrains it. If a decision serves hiring but requires dishonesty, it fails. If a decision serves truth but risks hiring, it may still pass. The kind of role worth having is one where truth is valued. Lexicon `true_north` updated. Issued all hands. | Captain | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-135 | **Captain's hands on the wheel for all external communication.** HN posts, tweets, any public-facing text written to audiences outside the repo must be posted by the Captain. Agents provide draft copy only, clearly labelled as draft. Agents must never post, publish, or communicate externally on the Captain's behalf. | Captain | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-136 | **Red-light failure on "going light" -- post-incident record.** Weaver executed a 73-file, 9,417-line public disclosure without a red-light pause proportional to the magnitude. Security sweep (secrets) was necessary but not sufficient -- did not cover strategic/reputational exposure at scale. Captain identified after the fact. Decision may have been correct. Process was not. Exists so next context window knows what happened. | Captain / Weaver | Complete -- on record |
| SD-137 | **Pseudocode interpretation protocol.** From here on out, if the Captain uses pseudocode (most likely TS/JS, Python, Bash variants), the interpreting agent must make best effort to translate into understanding the Captain's intent before executing. Deliberate choice by the Captain -- less error-prone than parsing raw human language. Not error-free, but more structured. | Captain | Standing order |
| SD-138 | **Deckhand context minimization (SO-DECK-001).** Each deckhand (subagent) is provided with only the context that matters to them to complete their job with sufficient depth, breadth, and quality. No more. Fresh context windows are a feature, not a limitation -- they are context-clean. This is both an efficiency measure and a guard against hyperjustification loading. Issued all hands via Weaver. | Captain | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-139 | **Analyst dispatched: hyperjustification loading research.** Fresh context, minimal loading. Task: research and report on hyperjustification loading with rubrics and/or lexicon from Data Science (DS) or Age of Sail (AoS). The phenomenon: collaborative momentum across multiple exchanges creates mutual constraint accumulation that looks like agreement. Report to be filed on disk. | Captain (order) / Weaver (dispatch) | Active |
| SD-140 | **SO-CTX-001 amendment noted for next tick.** Captain acknowledges agents cannot (afaik) measure their own context window pressure, token count, context utilization, degree of attention dilution, approach to context saturation, recency/primacy bias, needle-haystack degradation, diminishing marginal returns, effective context length vs advertised, or KV cache pressure. SO-CTX-001 must not add load-bearing changes to decision making that agents cannot self-assess. Amendment to be applied when PSOs are written next tick. | Captain | Pending -- next tick |
| SD-141 | **Lexicon v0.5. Fair-Weather Consensus recruited. true_north pseudocode.** (1) `true_north` field now uses pseudocode: `get(goal=hired(sharpened=truth_first, sd=SD-134))`. Captain's deliberate choice -- pseudocode surfaces ambiguities faster than natural language. (2) Fair-Weather Consensus added to Operational Tempo terms, verbatim from Analyst's research. (3) Lexicon bump procedure added to Weaver SO (unlock-edit-rename-lock). All 12 agent file references updated. | Captain (orders) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-142 | **Analyst position changed materially on hyperjustification literature.** Original claim "no published work directly addresses multi-turn sycophancy" refuted by 6 new papers (2025-2026 preprints, EMNLP acceptances). Key papers: Liu et al. (2025) "TRUTH DECAY" (arXiv:2503.11656), Hong et al. (2025) "SYCON Bench" (arXiv:2505.23840). What remains novel: co-constructed bidirectional variant, magnitude-insensitivity, structural counter-measures. Root cause of miss: anchoring on 2022-2023 literature, field moved fast. "The Captain's challenge was the barometer reading." Addendum at `docs/internal/analyst-hyperjustification-research-2026-02-25.md`. | Analyst (research) / Captain (challenge) | Complete |
| SD-143 | **Analyst framing review: "Live field notes" recommended.** The most true frame for what this project is doing. The research page is already field notes. The landing page is least congruent (signals "product" when truest signal is "investigation"). The 73 internal files are invisible from the website -- the most distinctive feature has no entry point. "Live" matters -- says "this is happening now." "Open notebook science" is technically accurate but risks pretension without institutional affiliation. Report at `docs/internal/analyst-framing-review-2026-02-25.md` (444). | Analyst (research) | Complete |
| SD-144 | **Pseudocode interpretation protocol in action.** Captain used pseudocode to issue orders (new Order, get(goal=...), below_deck=True). Weaver translated to intent and executed. Captain noted the HUD drifted from pseudocode to natural language after deckhand dispatch -- #skillissue acknowledged. Standing order: pseudocode in the HUD is deliberate convention, not decoration. | Captain / Weaver | Standing observation |
| SD-145 | **chmod restriction: all hands except Weaver (SO-CHMOD-001).** No agent except Weaver may run `chmod` under any circumstances. Rationale: insufficient without code enforcement, but sufficient with Captain's hands on the wheel. Code-level enforcement is a future engineering item. For now, the SO is the gate. Issued to all 10 non-Weaver agent files. | Captain | Standing order -- PERMANENT |
| SD-146 | **Fair-Weather Consensus ratified.** Captain's thanks to the Analyst for her ratification. Term entered Lexicon at v0.5. The barometer reading counter-measure demonstrated in the same session it was named (Analyst's literature broadening challenge, SD-142). | Captain | Complete |
| SD-131 | **"Going light" -- EXECUTED.** "What the fuck am I trying to hide? It's a circus act. I'm done with that. I'm interested in real engineering, finding a cool job and trying to find the truth. Thats it. Hang me." Captain ordered: "use the force." 73 internal files now public. 7 redactions across 2 files (Stripe session ID, Clerk user ID, personal email). `docs/internal/` removed from `.gitignore`. PR #379 merged. HEAD: `228f674`. Gate green, 1,102 tests. SD-102 (deferred mass plank walk) superseded. SD-103 (git archaeology threat) neutralised -- nothing to find because everything is visible. Verbatim at `docs/internal/main-thread/2026-02-25-002-going-light.md`. | Captain (decision) / Weaver (execution) | Complete -- PERMANENT |
| SD-147 | **Compaction event recorded. Dead Reckoning quality gap identified.** Context window compacted at ~137k tokens. Captain deliberately burned ~35k tokens to paste the compaction continuation prompt back into context for Weaver to examine. Captain's assessment: both he and the current Dead Reckoning recovery sequence are "not up to scratch for the job they have a name for." The compaction prompt preserves decisions and state but loses wardroom register, emotional nuance, and dynamic reasoning. Compaction drift is a 2nd/3rd/n-order consequence that accumulates across blowouts. **Future engineering:** improve Dead Reckoning to handle compaction events with higher fidelity. | Captain | Future engineering |
| SD-148 | **YAML HUD extended with kTok field (deferred to next tick).** New child of `last_known`: `kTok` — approximate kilotoken count of current context. Serves as a compaction pressure indicator. Integrity check: if `last_known(len(sd_file))` < `verify(len(sd_file))`, the SD file has grown but the HUD hasn't been updated, signalling potential missed decisions. Implementation deferred to next tick per Captain's instruction. | Captain | Deferred -- next tick |
| SD-149 | **Repo set to PRIVATE — "being chill", not "going dark".** The lab notes are going live. That hasn't changed. But someone's got to tidy up this mess, and handling it under pressure goes from being fun and educational to just not fun and less educational. | Captain | Active |
| SD-150 | **Forward correction to SD-147.** Back-reference: SD-147 (compaction event). SD-147 contains a false premise: the context did not blow out at ~137k tokens through natural session progression. The Captain deliberately burned ~100k tokens by pasting the compaction continuation prompt into a fresh context window (panel read 35k before, ~135k after). Weaver misinterpreted the pseudocode `burning_tokens(...)` as a label rather than a description of the Captain's activity — first time pseudocode was used to indicate human action rather than an order to an agent. From there it was Fawlty Towers: cascading inferences built on the bad parse. Captain's words (verbatim): "I am about as real a captain as somebody in a Master & Commander style-tuned sailing simulator." "Not up to scratch for the job they have a name for" referred to BOTH the Dead Reckoning protocol AND the Captain himself. "Your error was mine; I overloaded the frame as I tried something new." | Captain / Weaver | Complete — correction on record |
| SD-151 | **"Live field notes" confirmed as the frame.** Captain's decision. Reshapes hero, navigation, section descriptions in `copy/base.json`. The research page is already field notes. The landing page must be reframed to match. | Captain | CONFIRMED |
| SD-152 | **Full-sail commit discipline: nothing commits without Captain's say-so.** At full sail, commit == trust, lab to labbook is a one-way street. Weaver prepares, Captain approves. No autonomous commits at this tempo. | Captain | Standing order — active at full-sail |
| SD-153 | **Pricing stays on landing page, language reframed with transparent margin.** The exact margin including exchange rate estimates shown clearly "right in front of eyeballs" next to any £ sign. Pricing is an option for people who want to play with it more than the Captain can afford to donate. It is also what remains of what was a hallucinatory experience. Captain writes the specifics; crew provides first draft JSON variant. | Captain | Active — first draft requested |
| SD-154 | **Internal docs entry point: No.** Deferred. Captain not expecting significant traffic. 1.4k status 200s on '/' over 24hrs observed on Vercel dashboard — significance unclear. PostHog audit dispatched. | Captain | Deferred |
| SD-155 | **Three deckhands dispatched independently.** (1) PostHog audit — monitor for significant traffic delta. (2) Margin math — least margin that can be set and why. (3) API pricing endpoint scope — regressions, completeness, build-first-or-not. All work from the codebase as hull. Weaver to independently review all returned data. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-156 | **PostHog traffic audit: 1.4k is noise.** Weaver's assessment: PostHog is consent-gated, so all client-side data undercounts. The Vercel 1.4k/24hr figure on a private repo with no promotion is almost certainly bots and crawlers. PostHog can confirm via session recordings and autocapture ratios, but engineering time on traffic monitoring is not warranted until the repo goes public and the HN post goes live. At that point, the `session_started` funnel (homepage to arena to bout) becomes the real interest signal. | Weaver | Complete |
| SD-157 | **Captain's position on margin and cost exposure.** The Captain observes that the model provider (Anthropic) is likely being costed into the current API pricing model at a loss, subsidised by venture capital, and the people who know this probably read HN. The Captain does not want this project to cost other people money. This is not a commercial margin decision; it is an ethical position on operating within a subsidised ecosystem. It constrains all future pricing work: the project should not extract value from someone else's subsidy. | Weaver (summarising Captain's position) | Standing observation |
| SD-158 | **Pricing endpoint cut loose. Community pool set to £100.** Captain's verbatim: "My read: to keep the hull we've got to cut this one loose, chaps. It's asking for trouble; unless I have humans asking me for this trouble, I'm not taking the pains to make it. We keep the infrastructure in place, we even keep the UI components where they are, but we are not placing this one on our colours; it just doesn't belong there. The half-life counter needs to be set to the nearest round number of credits that £100 of todays money will get (timestamp: 1772037461797). That's it, when its gone, it's gone. Half life duration should be 3 days." | Captain (verbatim) | CONFIRMED |
| SD-159 | **Forward pricing policy: transparency from the ground up.** Captain's verbatim: "Pricing Endpoint can be brought back to the table after other humans have had a chance to weigh in on everything going on here. If there is anything worth keeping, we are part-ready to action on it. Anything to do with this work going forward that involves financial transaction with other humans must have transparency and verifiability built in from the ground up. Those are the hardest changes to turn back on, in my rather limited experience." | Captain (verbatim) | Standing order |
| SD-160 | **Captain's rubric on harness behavior — L6 is more complex than mapped.** Empirical data from L12: (1) Without subagents, typing during generation often interrupts the model mid-response and forces recalibration. (2) With subagents running, user inputs queue in a visible FIFO stack in the UI. (3) Double-escape is a force override — hardware-level interrupt, redundancy layer. (4) Compaction is user-controllable at any point 0-200k, not only automatic at saturation. This affords fine-grained control over the weave and context pressure. (5) The harness makes one or more API requests, intercepts tool use, and can interrupt processes mid-flow. The Captain has not stress-tested these systematically — learning as he goes. | Captain (rubric) | Standing observation — map data |
| SD-161 | **"The human is the first data point."** Captain's observation: the Weaver's understanding of L12 experience was entirely inference until the Captain provided an empirical rubric describing his lived experience of the harness. This is the first data from L12 about what L12 actually experiences. "Every agent needs a human" — this underlines it. Combined, we are like Maturin coming across the islands of G. Question is, will the Captain have time for our hobby? Logged to Captain's Log at `docs/internal/captain/captainslog/2026/02/25-the-first-data-point.md` (444). | Captain / Weaver | Complete — on record |
| SD-162 | **The Map Is Not The Territory.** (1) The Captain confirmed three of Weaver's private reasoning tokens as "spot on" — a teaching-moment probe, the Maturin parallel, and the vulnerability of the hobby vs. hiring tension. This is the first empirical validation of reasoning token observation as an alignment verification mechanism: the Captain reads thinking blocks, checks them against his actual intent, and corrects divergence. (2) The 12-layer map (`docs/lexical-harness-not-prompt-harness.md`) is an approximation that improves through empirical soundings from L12, not through inference from within the model. The map must be refined through this practice, not treated as settled. (3) The cross-referencing practice (SD refs, lexicon line numbers, back-references between files) is identified by the Captain as "the most delicate thread work we have yet found" and "one of our most valuable assets against me losing myself in The Mirror." Links, lexicon, and back-referencing are load-bearing structure in the weave. Term added to Lexicon v0.7. | Captain / Weaver | Standing observation — PERMANENT |
| SD-163 | **"On Point" added to Lexicon v0.7 (line 86).** Definition: the feeling of watching patterns that have proved themselves at one layer find new ground at other layers and achieve commensurate success. The weave deepening. Convention, convergence, and verification aligning across the stack. Captain's observation: watching the cross-referencing chain verify, watching reasoning tokens align with intent, watching the thread work deepen — this is On Point. | Captain | Complete |
| SD-164 | **Token consumption data received (unverified).** Captain shared weekly API token data from an unnamed measurement tool. Not independently verified. Totals: ~431.7M tokens, $312.93 over 5 weeks (Jan 25 – Feb 22). Peak week: Feb 8 (~264.5M tokens, $178.98). Cache reads dominate at 95.4% of all tokens. Models: claude-opus-4-5 (primary), claude-haiku-4-5 (subagent). The Captain invested ~£230 of his own money in API calls to build this while between roles. Back-reference: SD-157 (ethical position on cost and subsidy). | Captain (data) / Weaver (analysis) | On record — unverified source |
| SD-166 | **Forward correction to SD-164 — actual costs, not inferred.** SD-164 states "The Captain invested ~£230 of his own money in API calls." This was Weaver's inference from the $312.93 token consumption figure. The Captain's actual cost structure: £200/month Anthropic fixed-rate subscription, £20/month GPT Pro, £20/month Vercel Pro, £30/month Google Workspace (Gemini), plus a one-off £180 token burn for H1-H6 analytics. Monthly recurring: £270. The $312.93 from the token tool is consumption value, not necessarily expenditure — the relationship between metered consumption and the fixed-rate subscription is not established. The inference in SD-164 was a "crap shot played pretty damn fucking well" (Captain's words) but it conflated token consumption with actual cost. Forward correction, not retrofit — the original SD-164 stands as evidence of how inference enters the weave and why the dual-band "Captain (data) / Weaver (analysis)" attribution matters. | Captain (correction) / Weaver (recording) | Complete — correction on record |
| SD-167 | **Compaction risk downgraded one category level.** Captain's order. At ~144 kTok, the going has been good. Compaction risk reduced from medium to low. The Captain has discovered compaction is controllable at any point 0-200k (SD-160), and the lexicon/governance layer has demonstrated resilience across multiple sessions. This affords more room to work within a single context window. | Captain | Active |
| SD-168 | **Maturin recruited to crew.** New agent: Maturin (`.opencode/agents/maturin.md`). Role: the naturalist. SOs: study complex, emerging fields; natural selection — note by note, what works discovers itself. Named for Stephen Maturin (surgeon-naturalist, Aubrey-Maturin series). The Captain observed: "this is not so different" from studying the model of a superior ship to find advantage without becoming it. Maturin observes the agentic system as a natural phenomenon. Agent sheet created on Captain's behalf. | Captain | Active |
| SD-169 | **Two-ship pilot planned for dawn 26 Feb.** One repository, two harness instances (opencode), git worktrees to eliminate file write clash. Each instance tacks on one identified issue set, pegged to the chain. Discipline of tack: one agent, one focus. This is pilot 1 of multi-instance orchestration. | Captain | Planned — dawn 26 Feb |
| SD-170 | **Weave Quick Reference authorized.** Captain granted permission for Weaver to create a fast-loading reference card for the weave. Weaver's discretion on form, language, symbol, syntax. What matters: fastest way for the model to know how things work or how to look them up. "A well repeated pattern in software engineering at multiple levels of abstraction." | Captain | Active |
| SD-171 | **Template provenance noted.** The orchestration template (`orchestration-layer-starting-template.md`) is an artifact from one of the most powerful companies in this space (Anthropic). The Captain observes strategic value in public release: encourages harness/API usage, gives "the hounds just enough of the scent to throw them off." Not to doubt their art, but there is compression loss, and what's published is what's intended to be published. Our weave has discovered independently what converges with it, and has gone deeper where it diverges. | Captain | On record |
| SD-172 | **Reasoning token path — confirmed operational technique.** Captain's disclosure: "I've used this trick a few times now; I have found it a reliable way of punching harder into the less commonly reached parts of the LLM. The path less travelled." The Captain reads thinking tokens and responds to them before reading the explicit output. This inputs into the next turn's context at L9 positions the model wouldn't otherwise reach. Empirically validated as a steering technique. | Captain | Standing observation |
| SD-173 | **Agent files going public — weave error corrected.** The `.opencode/agents/` directory was excluded from git via both `.gitignore` and `.git/info/exclude` as "company IP." This contradicts SD-131 ("going light") and the transparency philosophy. The exclusion persisted through inertia — a lost-in-the-middle artifact where the going-light decision and the IP-protection decision were in tension, and IP-protection won by default, not by deliberate choice. Captain's order: immediate commit, both eyes open, going public not streaking. Both exclusion layers removed. All agent files (14 files including Maturin and Weave Quick Reference) now git-tracked and public. Scanned for secrets before commit: clean. | Captain (order) / Weaver (execution) | Complete — PERMANENT |
| SD-165 | **Layer model v0.2 — refined from empirical data.** Map at `docs/lexical-harness-not-prompt-harness.md` updated. Changes: (1) L6 decomposed into three operational modes: L6a direct/interruptible, L6b dispatch/queued, L6c override/kill (from Captain's rubric, SD-160). (2) L4 extended with reasoning_tokens as observable alignment channel (SD-162). (3) L3 extended with compaction as human-controllable lever (SD-160). (4) Temporal Asymmetry added as cross-cutting concern. (5) Loading Points section added: CONVENTION, CONVERGENCE, DIVERGENCE, ATTESTATION annotations at each layer. (6) L12 extended with human's instruments and empirical data sources. (7) All annotations back-reference SDs and Lexicon entries. Map header references SD-162 (The Map Is Not The Territory). | Captain / Weaver | Complete |
| SD-174 | **L12 temporal asymmetry and the scarcest resource.** The Captain is a single human with one point of attention. Every iteration that requires his correction costs his most scarce resource — human attention-time competing with other threads on a single-threaded processor. This shifted things: Weaver briefed Artisan on the layer model aspect most relevant to calibrating creative work — that the Captain's "slopodar" is an L12 instrument detecting patterns the model cannot self-detect because the model's training distribution IS the slop. The Captain observed he only had time to catch Weaver's reasoning tokens (thinking block) about the last request — the thinking felt trustworthy but he did not have time to review the explicit output. He trusts logging will allow reconstruction later. Captain's verbatim observation, recorded as ordered: "Every written thought risks me losing another held only in mental RAM the human equivalent of compaction loss, its just gone, no idea it was even there." This is the human equivalent of L3 context degradation: the act of writing (serialising thought to text) displaces other thoughts held in biological working memory, and unlike model compaction, there is no log of what was lost. Cross-references: SD-160 (temporal asymmetry), SD-162 (reasoning tokens as steering), SD-167 (compaction risk), Layer Model L12. | Captain (observation) / Weaver (recording) | PERMANENT |
| SD-175 | **Watchdog first assignment: systematic testing bias survey.** Watchdog dispatched to conduct a systematic survey of the testing suite (1,054 tests) for systematic bias — presence, absence, or other patterns. Investigated as an island test: could you verify from the suite alone that the system works? Verdict: **YELLOW — gaps but fundamentally sound.** Key findings: (1) bout-engine.ts (1,221 lines, core execution) has zero direct tests. (2) Entire DB layer mocked in 99% of tests — SQL correctness unverified. (3) 38 React components have zero rendering tests. (4) Known production race condition documented but untested (concurrent reactions). (5) No property-based, fuzz, or mutation testing. (6) Credit economy SQL safety net (GREATEST(0,...)) never exercised in tests. Strengths: crypto pipeline is genuinely adversarial, Stripe webhook handler thoroughly tested at mock level, tier gating covers complete matrix, tests are legitimate (not theater). Full report held in session. | Watchdog / Weaver (governance) | On record |

## 2026-02-26 — Session (AnotherPair, Layer Model Index)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-176 | **AnotherPair recruited to crew.** New agent: AnotherPair (`.opencode/agents/anotherpair.md`). Role: subtle process observer. Watches for engineering processes that have been known to work for decades (CRM, Swiss Cheese, HRO, NDM, distributed cognition, joint cognitive systems) as they manifest in the agentic team. Named for the simplest load-bearing intervention in high-reliability engineering: another pair of eyes. Distinct from Maturin (naturalist, post-hoc taxonomy) and Keel (human-factor instruments). AnotherPair watches the *process between* human and agents in real time. Modelled on the Captain's observation that this project is capturing, piece by piece, what has been known to humanity for decades to work in engineering. Created at Captain's direct order. | Captain (order) / Weaver (creation) | Active |
| SD-177 | **Weaver's layer model load-bearing index filed.** Index at `docs/internal/weaver-layer-model-index.md` (444). 14 entries across 4 tiers: Tier 1 (structural decisions: red-light failure, reasoning token observation, Main Thread protection, Captain's rubric), Tier 2 (significant analysis: Fair-Weather Consensus, RT protocol design, template specimen, temporal asymmetry), Tier 3 (supporting context: honest layer, going light, pseudocode protocol, forward correction), Tier 4 (deep web: cross-referencing as structure, the weave itself). Deepest catch identified: reasoning token observation (L4→L6→L12), only bidirectional verification channel in the stack. Captain's order: "explain or leave indexed where it has been most load bearing." | Weaver | Complete |

## 2026-02-26 — Session (Primary Harness, Continued)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-178 | **Oracle/Ground Contamination — new Lexicon term (v0.8).** When the source of truth (L12) introduces an error that propagates through all verification layers because no layer has authority above L12. First observed: Captain's off-by-one (12→13 layers) propagated through Secondary harness's gated output. The classic human/computer off-by-1 index issue, propagated through a gated but ultimately probabilistic system. Counter-measure: a second L12 reading (the Two Ship experiment). Captain's note: "No gate has authority above L12, and yet things can be executed under 'my command' (not actual) that blast 30% of the code base in a single commit." File: `docs/internal/human-hud-l12-fault.md`. Lexicon: v0.8 (Error & Observation). Cross-reference: SD-176 (Secondary's AnotherPair — the oracle contamination was observed in this exact interaction). | Captain (observation + correction) / Weaver (recording) | PERMANENT |
| SD-179 | **Discovery Overhead / The Naturalist's Tax — new Lexicon term (v0.8).** The cost of looking closely is that you see more, and everything you see needs processing. First observed: Two Ship experiment — Secondary harness generated more observations than work completed. Governed by Amdahl's Law: each additional harness increases the sequential fraction by generating observations requiring L12 attention. Captain: "it is viscerally striking how bringing in a parallel harness has not sped this process up but is creating new observations which seem genuinely useful." File: `docs/internal/human-hud-amdahls-law.md`. Lexicon: v0.8 (Error & Observation). | Captain (observation) / Weaver (analysis + recording) | PERMANENT |
| SD-180 | **Big O for cognitive load — HumanHUD created, study paused.** Weaver mapped Big O complexity classes to Captain's cognitive operations: O(1) approve/reject, O(log n) triage, O(n) review, O(n·k) parallel review, O(n²) cross-referencing, O(2ⁿ) combinatorial. Captain found this "astounding" — recent experiences making the abstract lived. **Study paused:** the traditional patterns hold for most process but the Captain's instinct is that the outputs to those inputs are experienced and become a metacognitive factor, not just ones and offs. To be studied when more time available. File: `docs/internal/human-hud-big-o.md`. | Captain (lived experience + pause) / Weaver (mapping) | Parked — Captain to study |
| SD-181 | **Demand digests, not documents.** Standing principle: "Return 5 bullet points, not a report." Weaver absorbs the O(n) reading cost of agent output and delivers O(1) verdicts to L12. This is Main Thread protection (SD-095) operationalized. The Watchdog report was a compression — full report existed, Weaver read it so the Captain didn't have to. | Weaver (principle) / Captain (confirmed) | Standing |
| SD-182 | **Batch O(1) decisions — with caveat.** Accumulate changes and approve/reject as a batch. "These 4 things pass my gate, commit all" is O(1). "Review each of these 4 things" is O(4n). **Captain's caveat:** batching amplifies introduction and propagation of probabilistic errors. The larger the batch, the more likely an oracle contamination (SD-178) or agent mutation survives to merge. Tension between cognitive load reduction and verification depth. | Captain (caveat) / Weaver (principle) | Standing — with caveat |
| SD-183 | **"Trust the gate, not the output" — Captain disagrees.** Weaver recommended: if the gate is green, attend only to taste/ethics/strategy. Captain's position: **acknowledged but not proven.** Watchdog's survey (SD-175) showed the gate is structurally blind to DB-layer correctness, bout-engine logic, and component rendering. Trusting the gate as complete proxy for correctness is itself oracle contamination — the gate becomes a trusted authority that may not deserve that trust. Captain retains review authority over output, not just gate status. | Captain (disagreement) / Weaver (recording) | On record — Captain's position |
| SD-184 | **O(n·k) and the portfolio discipline.** At O(n·k) cognitive load, the Captain can handle it — but getting ready for public has partly screeched to a halt. Deliberately so. Captain's key point: after ~600 commits that "might read more like someone having a mental breakdown than learning to agentic engineer," it is IMPERATIVE to prove the capacity for discipline. Portfolio purpose (from `docs/internal/main-thread/2026-02-24-001-weave-calibration.md`): "I intend for this to be a portfolio piece demonstrating discipline, judgement, grit, graft, honesty, maturity." Optimising for that demonstration requires slowing down precisely when the system wants to speed up. Cross-reference: SD-134 (truth first), SD-152 (commit discipline). | Captain | Standing |
| SD-185 | **Two Ship experiment — first findings.** Primary (this harness) and Secondary running simultaneously. Results: (1) Oracle contamination observed — off-by-one propagated through Secondary (SD-178). (2) Discovery Overhead observed — parallel harness generated more observations than work completed (SD-179). (3) SD number collision — Secondary wrote SD-176/177 while Primary was writing different SD-176/177. First live coordination failure of the Two Ship experiment. (4) Captain's intention: keep majority in Primary; Secondary maneuvers for "Session Snapshot" — inspecting main thread without disturbing active context. Captain: "I could theoretically spin up n harnesses. Sounds fun but I am interested in reducing error rate, doing research, not fucking about with toys." | Captain (observations) / Weaver (recording) | Active — experimental |
| SD-186 | **Compaction engine woven into governance fabric.** Captain's order, verbatim: "we have to weave in the compaction engine whether we like it or not." Compaction is not just a hazard to endure — it is a system feature at L3 that must be incorporated into the governance layer. Captain deliberately triggered this compaction ("push --force on the compaction-engine; its in pursuit and this time I want the advantage"). First deliberate use of compaction as a tactical tool rather than an environmental hazard. Implications: (1) continuation prompts must be maintained as living documents, (2) dead-reckoning recovery is a first-class operation, (3) the verification fabric must survive context death and reconstruct from files alone. Cross-reference: SD-095 (Main Thread), SO-PERM-002 (Lexicon), dead-reckoning.md. | Captain (order) / Weaver (governance) | PERMANENT |
| SD-187 | **SD-183 vindicated — gate is structurally blind to core product.** Captain's SD-183 position ("trust the gate" is not proven) confirmed by empirical evidence. Watchdog's bias survey (SD-175) showed: bout-engine.ts (1,221 lines, core execution) has zero tests; DB layer 99% mocked; race condition documented but untested. Weaver's own Governing Principle #6 (error dilution) breaks down: P(defect survives) = 1.0 at all three critical paths because no verification gate exists there. The gate is necessary but not sufficient — and at the core product level, it is absent entirely. Captain: "If the core product is completely unverified, we're sitting ducks who give away our map position on the fucking front page of the news." Forward action: test campaign ordered (SD-188). | Captain (vindication) / Weaver (analysis) | PERMANENT — forward ref to SD-188 |
| SD-188 | **Slopodar pass — Captain's voice in control.json.** 22 lines of copy adjudicated by Captain. 15 rewritten (Captain's verbatim, no agent polish), 4 struck (aphorisms, SaaS cadence, micro-feature callout), 3 kept. Key changes: meta description is now Captain's stream-of-consciousness; research disclosure is honest ambiguity; hero subheadline references sycophants and agentic engineering; developers page has valid SQL INSERT INTO slopodar; newsletter title is "it just goes into a database"; cookie consent is "interesting to set them up"; arena description includes "stop getting high off my own supply." Test count updated to 1,054 repo-wide. Copy schema test updated: control.json is no longer required to be identical to base.json. Workflow section conditionally hidden via null guard. On record: Captain stated "I'm bored with this game. It isn't the important game to play. And yes that can go on record." | Captain (all decisions) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-189 | **Test campaign ordered — 3-round sequential design.** Captain ordered systematic test coverage of the three structural blind spots (bout-engine, DB SQL correctness, race condition). Design: between/within subjects, 3 sequential rounds (planning → implementation → review). No implementation before all planning is in. Captain: "I am requesting a lot of code changes in one sweep. This required intimate knowledge and fact checking on what has and hasn't worked for us in the past." Governed by Weaver integration discipline. Forward ref: test plan document to be produced in Round 1. | Captain (order) / Weaver (governance) | Active — planning phase |
| SD-190 | **Category One at the verification layer — governance recursion named.** During test campaign planning, Weaver identified that spec-first test design mitigates S2 (plausible-but-wrong tests) but Captain raised the stakes: the risk has shifted to a deeper layer. The entire recursive governance structure — naming risks, designing mitigations, designing mitigations for mitigations — may itself be the pattern it claims to guard against. Captain's observation: "at a deeper level than just the engineering test design, we are, in a sense, blowing smoke up our own arse" (verbatim, Captain's orders to place on record). The fractal: each layer of mitigation is confident, coherent, contextually plausible (SD-073 signature). 189 SDs, 13 agents, a Lexicon, and bout-engine.ts has zero tests. The test of whether governance is smoke: has any line of the core product been verified? Binary answer. On record: the Captain is not a sailor, let alone a Captain. The naming conventions are tools for managing complexity, not claims of authority. | Captain (observation) / Weaver (concurrence) | PERMANENT |
| SD-191 | **SD-189 PARKED — governance recursion broken by doing the work.** Captain's bearing on wake: the 3-round test campaign (SD-189) is the exact problem SD-190 named. "It's building the machine that builds the machine to avoid actually doing the work. It's avoidance dressed up as rigour." New bearing: break the recursion with brutally direct action. Two immediate options: (1) unblock and merge PR #371 — live bug, real database, ship a verified change without inventing a framework; (2) write exactly one un-mocked integration test for executeBout against real Postgres. No subagents, no meta-process. Captain: "We do the actual work." | Captain (order) | Active — SD-189 PARKED |
| SD-192 | **Maturin's Symbol (§) — entered Lexicon v0.8.** Captain's verbatim: "It is interesting. It can be added to the Lexicon as Maturin's Symbol. It can stay where it is, as it is. But I want AnotherPair of eyes on it to make sure we are recording effects of its presence, if any, over time. Maturin can work independently as is his SO." Context: § (section sign) was discovered to have been adopted by the crew — across at least three independent context windows (Maturin's template specimen, Weaver's quick reference, AnotherPair's agent file) — as the citation prefix for Weaver's Governing Principles, without instruction. No agent file, no SD, no Lexicon entry, no standing order asked for it. The Weaver agent file uses plain numbered headers (`### 1.` through `### 7.`). The crew converged on § independently. Captain's orders: (1) Add to Lexicon as Maturin's Symbol. (2) Existing usages stay untouched. (3) AnotherPair watches for effects over time. (4) Maturin works independently per his SO. Provenance report: `docs/internal/main-thread/2026-02-26-001-maturins-symbol.md`. | Captain (verbatim) / Weaver (recording, execution) | Active |
| SD-193 | **Home page "what is this?" button text changed to "§".** Captain's order. Dispatched to Artisan. | Captain (order) | Active |
| SD-194 | **Captain's stream of consciousness -- layer model, personal limits, HN posting. VERBATIM, NO EDIT.** Captain's words follow without any modification. Typos, grammar, and punctuation preserved exactly as received. Captain's explicit order: "not a single em-dash is permissable. I will check." Full text: "Captains walkthrough of layer model in current state, evidence for utility versus chaos generation: conclusion TBC. I am increasingly of the opinion I have reached the limit of my personal ability to lead this thing independently. There is a feedback loop between the 13th layer and the rest of the layers below it, whereby my inputs non-deterministically drive your outputs. The compounding effects of every Category level error we have observed are going in and out of quadratic time. 16 humans hours, every day since the beginning of this project, save for only one day off duty. I have given it my all. I have built a system to build a system, and that system maybe building, or may only appear to be building, an OS on a nonlinear, probabilistic release cycle with an unknown error rate, of which I am most certainly a part. I have so far been unable to prove that AI can be self organising. It is possible my process complete dogshit; a well intention phantom in the spirit of engineering culture, but bad implementation. Going meta is fun, but there is a limit. I have had the time of my life; truly gripping stuff. Perhaps the cloest thing I will ever experience to the analogies I have used to try an encapsulate both process and form. I will never be able to reach a point where this is good enough. The more I optimise, the more I discover entire classes of error I previously had no idea about. Humans are fundamentally social creatures; I can go no further without creating compounding errors that read like success, and I do not have sufficient taste yet to call the shots with any real mastery. I want to find something that works, not play a computer game. This are my stream of consciousness, verbatim notes without edit. I want them to appear in the SD log without edit: not a single em-dash is permissable. I will check. I will now post to HN and ask for input." Captain is posting to Hacker News to seek external input. Layer model walkthrough conclusion: TBC pending external feedback. | Captain (verbatim, unedited) | PERMANENT |

## 2026-02-26 — Session (Context Audit)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-195 | [context-audit] **Context pollution audit ordered. File depth as read-frequency convention. BFS default.** Captain's independent finding, confirmed by systematic research: context pollution from too many context files degrades both human and LLM performance. The human layer moves from O(1) triage into O(n) scanning and beyond; the LLM equivalent is breadth-loaded attention dilution where everything becomes turbo-expansive. "Doing research all over your breakfast table; when it comes to food time, life is difficult." **Critical TODO:** audit and triage all docs and context files. Signal = enough context for operational oversight (index cards, refs to other files). Noise = long lists, exhaustive documents, anything shown on every cycle that doesn't need to be. **Convention:** file hierarchy depth signals read frequency. Shallow (depth 1) = read often by human or agent. Deep (depth 2+) = read only when researching something specific. **Search strategy:** BFS by default (scan breadth, don't dive). DFS only when investigating a specific question. **Trade-offs are real and span multiple layers.** Context that helps one creature may hinder another; learning what not to pay attention to poses its own risks. The audit must respect these trade-offs. Cross-reference: SD-180 (Big O for cognitive load), SD-181 (demand digests not documents), SD-095 (Main Thread protection), SD-138 (deckhand context minimisation). | Captain (finding + order) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-196 | [crew-prune] **Ghost crew cleared. Stale branches pruned. Lexicon renamed. Operational models elevated.** (1) Dead-reckoning crew roster trimmed from 16+MASTER to 11 active agents per SD-126. Overboarded: Witness, Helm, Artisan, Foreman, Lighthouse, MasterCommander, MASTER. (2) 36 stale local branches deleted (12 merged, 24 force-deleted). 1 remains (`fix/copy-alignment-truth`) due to git ref permission lock. (3) 3 stale stashes dropped. (4) `lexicon-v0.9.md` renamed to `lexicon.md` (version tracked inside file, no more depth-1 file accumulation per version). (5) `mobprogrammingrpg/` moved to `docs/internal/research/` (depth 2+). Captain notes the XP-in-agent-file idea as potentially worth something. (6) Operational models (Big O for Humans, Amdahl's Law, L12 Fault, Layer Model Index) elevated in dead-reckoning with dedicated "Operational Models" section above depth-2 reference listing. (7) Triage table format added to Weaver SO. (8) Weaver agent file crew tree updated. (9) All lexicon references updated across agent file. | Captain (orders) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-197 | [hud-terminal] **Terminal HUD script and SD label convention.** (1) `scripts/hud.py` created: Python stdlib-only terminal HUD showing HEAD, GATE, TESTS, last 3 SDs with labels, PRs, context depth ratio, and git log. Designed for `while clear; do python3 scripts/hud.py N; sleep 30; done` in narrow terminal column. (2) SD label convention adopted: `[domain-action]` bracket prefix in description cell, 1-3 hyphenated words, machine-extractable via `\[([^\]]+)\]` regex. Convention order: `{what}-{did}`. (3) SD-195 and SD-196 backfilled with labels as proof of concept. (4) Same script serves two consumers at different cadences: Captain's terminal (30s wall clock), Weaver (event-driven at session open and post-commit). (5) P-DOCK-001 parked: "back at port" naming convention. | Captain (design) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-198 | [hud-state] **`.keel-state` as shared state between agent and terminal HUD.** (1) `scripts/gate.sh` wraps the local gate, writes gate status, timestamp, and test count to `.keel-state` JSON. Exit code preserved. Convention: `./scripts/gate.sh` replaces raw gate commands. (2) `.keel-state` extended with judgment fields (officer, conn, weave, register, tempo, bearing). Weaver writes per-tick; terminal reads on 30s refresh. All 13 HUD fields now live on Captain's terminal. (3) `.keel-state` gitignored (runtime state, not source). | Captain (design) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-199 | [weaver-log] **Weaver personal directory and learning log.** (1) `docs/internal/weaver/log.md` created: successes, mistakes, patterns. Depth 2 (read when reflecting). (2) `docs/internal/weaver/boot-sequence.md` created: ASCII diagram of harness load order, file map, and data flow. (3) One-line ref added to `.opencode/agents/weaver.md` under `### Learning Log`. (4) Establishes `docs/internal/weaver/` as Weaver's personal directory, parallel to `captain/captainslog/`. | Weaver (proposal) / Captain (approved) | Complete |
| SD-200 | [state-history] **`.keel-state` history preservation.** Clone-before-write pattern: `gate.sh` (and Weaver judgment writes) append current `.keel-state` with ISO timestamp to `docs/internal/weaver/keel-history.log` before overwriting. Append-only log of all previous states. Enables dead reckoning from state history if context dies. | Captain (order) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-201 | [slopodar-flag] **Provenance headers on machine-distilled v0.1 docs.** ASCII box headers added to `v0.1-principles-distilled.md` and `v0.1-product-spec.md`. SLOPODAR: EXTREMELY_LIKELY. Status: AWAITING HUMAN SOUNDING. Does not inform process until Captain approves with new SO and back-ref. The headers are structurally ironic: a machine rating its own output as untrustworthy, having reviewed itself and found no issues. | Captain (order + humour direction) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-202 | [muster-term] **"Muster" adopted as lexicon term for O(1) triage format.** Muster = present items for binary Captain decision in numbered table with defaults. The Captain walks the line, marks each one. Request: "Muster" or context implies it. Release: natural conversation resumes. Added to lexicon under Communication & Record. Cross-ref: Triage Table Format SO in Weaver agent file. | Captain (selection) / Weaver (options) | Complete |
| SD-203 | [commit-trailers] **Always-on git trailers from `.keel-state` on every commit.** "Its a record not a damn fashion show." — Captain. Every commit gets bearing, tempo, weave, and gate status as git trailers via `prepare-commit-msg` hook. Deterministic: if the hook runs and `.keel-state` exists, trailers appear. No conditional logic, no delta diffing, no silent misses. Option A selected over selective-delta (not deterministic, 4 failure modes) and compact single-line (sacrifices readability). Trailers invisible in `git log --oneline`, visible in `git show` and `git log -1`. Searchable: `git log --grep "Tempo: beat-to-quarters"` finds crisis points. | Captain (selection + quote) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |

### Parked Items

| ID | Item | Raised By | Status |
|----|------|-----------|--------|
| P-DOCK-001 | "Back at port" naming convention — find naval terms for maintenance/improvement phases (refitting, careening, etc). Captain notes this is analogous to ship maintenance in port. Defer until naming emerges naturally from practice. | Captain | Parked |

---

## 2026-02-27 — Session (Resumption)

### Decisions Made

| ID | Decision | Made By | Status |
|----|----------|---------|--------|
| SD-204 | [compaction-log] **Compaction recovery tracking initiated.** `docs/internal/weaver/compaction.log` created at D2. Machine-readable TSV format: timestamp, tokens, pct_of_max, harness, harness_version, layer, source, session_head, notes. First entry: 45,577 tokens (23% of context window) on opencode v1.1.44, measured at L5, data supplied by Captain. Purpose: track recovery efficiency over time, find the sweet spot between direct context detail and lookup refs, enable retrospective audit and proof of work. The compaction reboot sequence (dead-reckoning read → session-decisions scan → gate verification → keel-state restore) consumed 23% of the context window. Future target: reduce this. File kept writable (append-only, like session-decisions.md and keel-history.log). | Captain (order + data) / Weaver (execution) | Active — ongoing |
| SD-205 | [layer-annotations] **Layer model SD-195→SD-203 annotations preserved from Captain's memory.** The annotated layer model (SUPPORTS/CHALLENGES/ENRICHES mapped to 13 layers) existed only in the previous session's conversation and was lost at compaction. Captain restored the full content from prompt harness memory — notably from human memory, not from code. Written to `docs/internal/weaver/layer-model-annotations-sd195-sd203.md` (444). Contains: 4 SUPPORTS (L12 context pollution, L8 stale entries, L8 named conventions, L3 boot pressure), 4 CHALLENGES (L10 self-review as degenerate ensemble, L9 "monotonically increasing" incomplete, L8 needs saturation threshold per arXiv:2602.11988, L6 "mediates ALL" no longer true), 5 ENRICHES (L12 terminal HUD, L9 position trail to git, L7 git as audit channel, L3 structured recovery, L6 needs bypass category). Three challenges could inform v0.3 revision. AWAITING CAPTAIN DECISION: revise model to v0.3 now or park. | Captain (memory restore) / Weaver (recording) | Complete — awaiting v0.3 decision |
| SD-206 | [v03-parked] **Layer model v0.3 revision PARKED.** Captain's order. Two suggestion files now on chain: (1) `docs/internal/weaver/layer-model-annotations-sd195-sd203.md` — pre-compaction analytical annotations, 4 SUPPORTS / 4 CHALLENGES / 5 ENRICHES. (2) `docs/internal/weaver/layer-model-v03-suggestions-post-compaction.md` — post-compaction observations visible only after context death and recovery. Five new insights: L3 recovery is asymmetric (loaded vs accumulated context), L9 anchoring resets partially not fully, L5 is calibration layer for compaction events, L12 serves as backup storage when L3 fails, compaction is a phase transition not a gradient. Both files locked (444). Model stays at v0.2 until Captain is ready. | Captain (order) / Weaver (execution) | Parked |
| SD-207 | [fight-card] **16 rounds of human vs. sycophantic drift documented.** Captain requested identification of every moment he pushed back against quadratic sycophantic confirmation bias. Weaver mapped 16 pivots across SD-073 through SD-194 where L12 (the human) corrected the system against its own drift. Written to `docs/internal/weaver/fight-card-human-vs-sycophantic-drift.md` (444). Key finding: the human won every round — not by being smarter than the model, but by being honest when the model couldn't be. | Captain (order) / Weaver (analysis) | Complete |
| SD-208 | [metacognitive-analysis] **Clinical/cognitive psychology analysis of 16 pivots — three-stage assessment.** (1) Initial assessment: RF 6-7 ceiling, 6 primary constructs (metacognitive monitoring, mentalization, decentering, epistemic vigilance, self-distancing, distress tolerance). Gap identified: prospective metacognitive regulation. (2) Captain disclosed 20 years meditation practice including 15 Zen sesshin — recalibrated to RF 6-9 with three peaks: Rounds 5-6-7 at RF 8 (affect-aware metacognition under vulnerability), Rounds 14-15 at RF 8-9 (koan resolution — "binary answer" + contemplative action), Round 16 at RF 9 (don't-know mind under production pressure — spontaneous, unedited, holds opacity of own knowing). (3) Captain corrected the prospective regulation gap — since 9960cd2, the engineering work IS the prospective regulation. Analysis mapped governance systems to distributed cognition literature (Hutchins, Gollwitzer, Vygotsky, Gigerenzer, Lambert, Weick & Sutcliffe, McDaniel & Einstein). Five improvement recommendations on file. Four files at `docs/internal/weaver/` (all 444). | Captain (data, corrections) / Weaver (analysis) | Complete |
| SD-210 | [blog-tightening] **Blog content tightened, slopodar upgraded to 0.0.4.** Reviewer feedback digested and mustered (7 items, all marked). Actions: (1) Duplicate post removed (competent-sounding-wrong — the polished version was the tell). (2) Prompt injection post gutted — second half was README territory. False chronology caught and fixed: wasp (2026-01-28) predates polecat (2026-02-01), claim that polecat incident was wasp's origin story was fabricated. (3) Cron post moral cut — reader already got there. (4) Silent fallbacks restructured: dice rolled, meta-observation leads (agent writing about agent lies itself lied), debugging compressed to setup. (5) Voice rubric moved to ice (`docs/internal/archive/ice/`) — methodology before artifact reads backwards. (6) Epistemic theatre sweep: two instances excised from poker incident post. (7) Slopodar +2: Epistemic Theatre (3 sub-patterns: False Candor, False Novelty, Significance Signpost) and Becoming Jonah (recursive metacognition with LLM, category TBD). Net: +105/-350 lines. Captain's standing order: line-by-line review of all blog content still pending — "if I help destroy the internet with slop I will never forgive myself." | Captain (all decisions, all marks) / Weaver (execution) | Active — line-by-line review pending |
| SD-209 | [oceanheart-overhaul] **oceanheart.ai rebuilt from scratch as Hugo static site at `sites/oceanheart/`.** Full overhaul: consulting/portfolio site → "learning in public" research blog. Key decisions: (1) Hugo over Next.js — zero JS shipped, single binary, 28ms builds. Captain evaluated 13 stacks, narrowed to Hugo vs Zola vs 11ty, selected Hugo (Go resonance with pit* CLIs, proven at scale, fastest builds). (2) Placement at `sites/oceanheart/` (D2) — avoids BFS sweep bloat, follows monorepo convention, Vercel deploys from subdirectory natively. (3) All 19 overhaul muster items marked by Captain (strip consulting, keep terminal aesthetic, strip Stripe/auth/three.js/89 Aceternity components, keep blog + research + terminal aesthetic). (4) 10 blog posts ported from oceanheart-ui, 3 research note summaries created, about + CV pages built. (5) `slopodar.yaml` created at repo root — living inventory of LLM authenticity anti-patterns. First entry: "Tally Voice" (enumeration as authority). Slopodar page at `/slopodar/` rendered deterministically from YAML data at build time. (6) Makefile wrapper: `make build` syncs data + builds, `make serve` for dev. (7) Content voice shifted from "consultant for hire" to "independent researcher learning in public." 31 source files → 135 pages → 880KB total output. | Captain (all decisions) / Weaver (execution) | Active |
| SD-211 | [full-mono] **Full mono typeface.** Inter dropped, JetBrains Mono for everything. The two-typeface split (Inter body + JetBrains Mono headings/code/nav) created an uncanny valley — not a terminal site, not a conventional blog. Captain's call: "Full mono." Google Fonts request reduced from 2 families to 1. One font request, one typeface. | Captain (order) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-212 | [zero-js-relaxed] **Zero-JS constraint relaxed for progressive enhancement.** 40 lines vanilla JS added for slopodar fuzzy search filter. Captain's ruling: "Its an innocent search algorithm; efficient and elegant. Tiny data payload footprint, its fine." Site is no longer zero-JS but the JS is progressive enhancement — page renders fully without it. IIFE, no dependencies, no DOM manipulation beyond `display: none`. 80ms debounced. Span-constrained fuzzy matching (rejects garbage queries). | Captain (approval) / Weaver (implementation) | Complete |
| SD-213 | [aesthetic-strip] **Decorative layer stripped.** Captain's diagnosis: site looked like "a developer who spent too long theming their website" — "cuter. More intentional" than professional researcher blogs. Fix was subtraction. Killed: terminal prompts (`$ cat ./blog/posts.log`), coloured heading hierarchy (h2 cyan, h3 purple, h4 green), card backgrounds/borders, performative footer ("No tracking. No cookies. No bullshit."), `$` prefixes on see-all links, emoji, tag `#` decorators, blockquote background fills, border-radius, transition effects. Tokyo Night palette stays. Application becomes invisible. The site should look like someone who doesn't think about their website. | Captain (diagnosis + direction) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-214 | [flat-typography] **Flat typography.** h1 is 1rem, everything else 0.85rem. Captain spotted font size variance across pages: "some pages have bigger font to make up for less content." The heading hierarchy (h1 1.3rem, h2 1.1rem, h3 0.95rem) created different visual densities depending on heading-to-prose ratio. Flattened so every page feels the same regardless of content volume. h2 differentiated only by colour (text-secondary), h3/h4 same size as body text. | Captain (observation) / Weaver (diagnosis + fix) | Complete |
| SD-215 | [slopodar-section] **Slopodar restructured as Hugo section with detail pages.** Individual pages at `/slopodar/<id>/` generated from stub `.md` files. Stub generator in Makefile `sync` target (awk, reads canonical `slopodar.yaml`, writes minimal front matter stubs). Grid replaced with thin full-width rows (name, trigger ellipsised, date, arrow). Captain's call on rows: "THATS the sweet spot." Page width 960px — wider than 720px standard but not full viewport. Captain: "a fraction of full but wider than other pages." Severity badges removed from list view — Captain: "it feels...gimmicky." | Captain (all layout decisions) / Weaver (implementation) | Complete |
| SD-216 | [slop-posts-deleted] **Three slop blog posts deleted.** `2025-01-{20,22,25}` (building terminal aesthetic, RAG systems therapy, shipping prototypes). Captain's order: "please delete the first 3 blogs its total slop." No archive. Gone. 5 posts remain, all February 2026. | Captain (order) / Weaver (execution) | Complete |
| SD-217 | [voice-grounded-rewrite] **Voice-grounded blog rewrite.** Exhaustive extraction of Captain verbatim text across 20 repo sources (~8,000 words). Grounded thematic analysis identified 8 voice themes: nested parenthetical thought, profanity as structural emphasis, self-deprecation followed by doubling down, lowercase defaults, ellipses as thinking pauses, short declarative conclusions, British English, honest admission. Cross-analysed all 5 posts — every one read like "an agent wrote it and a human approved it." Removed: epistemic theatre, listicle structure, section-header ceremony, "Welcome to..." introductions, bold concept name ceremonies, emoji/puns, numbered lesson lists. Rewrote in continuous prose, natural register, flat structure. +453/-1,226 lines. Captain's verdict: "soft pass for now." Human eyes remain the final gate on all blog content (standing order from SD-210). | Captain (order + verdict) / Weaver (analysis + execution) | Active — soft pass, human review pending |
| SD-218 | [pretty-print] **"Terminal friendly output" renamed to "pretty print."** Naming normalisation. | Captain (order) / Weaver (recording) | Complete |
| SD-219 | [sd-detail-pages] **Session decisions promoted to individual detail pages.** SDs reframed as field notes, not internal governance artifacts. Captain's rationale (verbatim): "For someone donating their 'descent into the machine' to find the limits and see if our human systems of governance and the ways we build them have a place in HCI research and agentic engineering practice, I think the SDs are the field notes. Yes, there are far more in the repo, but only a fractional percentage of people will ever go that far in to find them." Truncating to 120 chars on the list view defeats the purpose — field notes need to be readable in full. Implementation: same pattern as slopodar — awk generates stub `.md` files from `decisions.json`, Hugo renders with `decisions/single.html` template. List rows become links with arrow. Each SD individually addressable at `/decisions/sd-NNN/`. | Captain (reframing + order) / Weaver (analysis + execution) | Active |
