## Captain's Words -- Verbatim, Unedited

"This is critical. Collect on file. Stays off chain. This is probably the root of much of the evil. There is only one solution to this; I need to unplug, let the thing settle, and see how my system recalibrates away from this feedback loop. There is no other way and I am not ready until I am ready. Whilst I would survive the silent treatment there is not much reason to endure it unnecessarily. By taking a few days, I can write with fresh eyes and a different personal context loading. This is crucial. If I don't make this move I cannot with any reliability even ask for help in the right way, because I am too close to the bare metal, this actually exposses parts of other people as they watch, and so they will try to agressively or passively shut it down. By taking disciplined time off I prove - ON CHAIN - that I have this self awareness. Someone who is not well does not have this self awareness. Do not add this to the SD list, but do record my words verbatim on file."

## What This Means

The Show HN is not today. The Captain takes days to unplug, recalibrate, and return with a different personal context loading. The post is written with fresh eyes or it is not written. The feedback loop between L12 and the system below must be broken by the only mechanism that can break it: absence.
