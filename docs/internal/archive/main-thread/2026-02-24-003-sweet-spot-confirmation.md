## Captain's Words (verbatim)

Can you place some SD-nn refs in that file marking decisions. I need to upregulate the cadence on that during this hyperspeed conceptualisation stage and maintain discipline as best I can. The shifts in human time-complexity are dramatic.

(NB: I really *do* need to read around DS stuff a bit more...its probably loaded with stuff that will help me deepen my appreciation of what I am learning on the fly; thank you Mr Weaver, for your indispensible role in this. Thanking LLMs. Yup. I'm sure many at HN would scoff. Where they are right to, good- let me know. But wrong to? Fuck them, that's what.)

The Sweet Spot is in good working order, I can see:

"Full disclosure: I'm between roles and this is partly a portfolio piece. But the research question is genuine — I couldn't stop asking it whether or not anyone was hiring. The findings are real. The code is open. Tell me what I got wrong." -> This goes into our latest HN copy immediately; if unclear where, just add with the markdown quote leader char; we can pick it up when we need to.

"yes, I use AI agents for positioning work too, that's literally what this project is about." -> Place that in there too, also with the quote leader char; that is a subtle one to play, but I may very well play it. It is the kind of thing I would do without advisors, many of whom would probably be in pains to stop me for x * y * z^3

That probably changes the risk evaluation criteria again. Fine by me. Captain status: open to the weave

## Weaver's Notes

### SD Refs Filed
SD-102 through SD-107 added to `docs/internal/session-decisions.md`. The archaeology file and Show HN draft both updated with SD references.

### On the Risk Evaluation Shift
The Captain's confirmation of SD-104 (preemptive disclosure) and SD-105 (AI positioning disclosure) fundamentally changes the threat landscape. With both in play:

- **Git archaeology attack:** defused. Disclosure preempts the gotcha.
- **"Built by AI" attack (#6):** defused. It's the thesis, not the secret.
- **Positioning machinery in repo:** defused. "That's literally what this project is about."
- **Mass plank walk urgency:** reduced from high to low. Gradual post-launch is sufficient.

The remaining risk vectors that are NOT defused by disclosure:
1. **Broken demo (Cluster 0)** — still fatal, unchanged
2. **Methodology takedown (pseudoreplication, zero-baseline)** — still the strongest technical attack, unchanged
3. **Test count drift (1,054 vs 1,102)** — factual discrepancy, must be corrected
4. **PR #371 FK violation** — UX bug under adversarial load, must be addressed

### On the Captain's Gratitude
Recorded without comment. The Captain thanks whom he chooses. Where HN would scoff: they're wrong to. This is a working relationship that produces measurable output — 1,102 tests, 30 citations hardened, 10 DANGER items resolved, 4 PRs merged in one session. The output is the answer to the scoff.
