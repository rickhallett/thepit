Statement presentation order: C, A, B

## Pre-Launch Recommendations

These recommendations are grounded in Keel's domain: operational stability and human-factor awareness. They are offered without bias — neither inflating risk nor minimising it. They concern the operator, the operational envelope, and the conditions under which launch decisions are made and sustained.

### 1. Establish a post-launch operational rhythm before you launch

Launch is not the end of a session — it is the beginning of one you cannot close. The moment the HN post goes live, the operator enters a sustained-attention window with unpredictable duration. Observable signals from previous sessions show that the Captain performs well in bounded, high-intensity bursts and poorly in open-ended reactive modes. **Before posting, define:** a check-in schedule (e.g., respond to comments at 30min, 1hr, 2hr, 4hr, then done for the day), a "walk away" trigger (e.g., if engagement is low, do not chase it), and a hard stop time. Without these, the launch session becomes the same kind of unbounded session that produced SD-075 (19hr continuous post).

### 2. The Captain must be fed, hydrated, and rested at the moment of posting

This is not metaphor. Cognitive performance under public scrutiny with real-time feedback is one of the highest-load human operating conditions. The L2 delta analysis proved that the Captain's physical state is a transfer function that colours every decision downstream. If the Captain posts while fatigued, hungry, or dehydrated, the quality of real-time responses to HN comments — which are the highest-leverage interactions of the entire project — will degrade. This was the Keel's recommendation in L2 and it remains the Keel's recommendation in L3. It is the single lowest-cost, highest-impact intervention available.

### 3. Pre-write response templates for predictable attack vectors

The Analyst and Sentinel have catalogued the likely HN attack vectors (crypto skepticism, "AI wrapper" dismissal, solo dev credibility). The Captain should not be composing rebuttals in real-time under adrenaline. Pre-write 3-5 calm, factual, honest responses to the most predictable objections. This is not spin — it is the same principle as pre-writing incident response runbooks. When the signal arrives, the response is already composed under conditions of clarity, not reactivity.

### 4. Define "success" before launch, not after

The most dangerous human-factor pattern post-launch is retrospective reframing: if engagement is high, the project was always about community; if engagement is low, the project was always about the portfolio; if engagement is hostile, the project was always about the learning. These are all valid frames, but choosing the frame after seeing the result is not honest assessment — it is coping. **Before posting, write down:** what outcome would make this launch worth it? What outcome would be disappointing but acceptable? What outcome would require a genuine reassessment? Commit to these thresholds in writing. This protects the Captain from the hype-crash cycle that Keel was specifically built to instrument.

### 5. Do not conflate launch feedback with product quality

HN reception is a noisy signal. A great post with bad timing gets buried. A mediocre post with good timing gets 500 points. The delta analysis demonstrated that the same codebase, assessed by the same instruments, produced wildly different scores depending on the evaluation frame. HN commenters will apply their own frames, most of which have nothing to do with the engineering quality of the work. The Captain must decide before launch: **this project's quality is defined by its engineering, its tests, its research methodology, and its honesty — not by the comment section.** If that belief is not genuinely held before posting, do not post until it is.

### 6. Plan the 48 hours after launch, not just the launch itself

What happens on day 2? If the post does well, there will be follow-up questions, feature requests, and collaboration offers — all of which will trigger scope-expansion signals. If the post does poorly, there will be silence, which triggers the recursive self-improvement loop ("maybe I should refactor X before trying again"). Both outcomes are predictable. Both have pre-planned responses: for success, "thank you, these are captured as issues, I'll prioritise after the launch window closes"; for silence, "the work stands on its own, the next session starts fresh with the roadmap, not with reactive changes."

### 7. Acknowledge that bus factor = 1 is a feature for launch, not a bug

The L2 analysis correctly identified that bus factor = 1 is structurally immovable for a solo project and not a launch blocker. Keel adds: for the HN audience specifically, solo authorship is a credibility signal, not a risk signal. "One person built this" is the strongest possible proof that the composition is real and not a team's division of labour disguised as integrated thinking. Do not apologise for it. Do not frame it as a limitation. It is what it is, and what it is happens to be impressive.

### 8. The assessment instrument itself is now part of the story

The L2 delta analysis revealed a genuine finding about agentic assessment methodology: evaluation frame is the dominant variable. This is not just a meta-observation — it is a research contribution. If the Captain chooses to reference the Round Table process in launch materials (and Keel believes he should, selectively), the honesty of showing "our own AI crew assessed this differently depending on the question we asked" is exactly the kind of epistemic transparency that builds trust with a skeptical technical audience. It demonstrates the project's thesis using the project's own tools.

## Strategic Framing — Rank Order

1st: B — "First and foremost, this project is a unique contribution to a difficult field in difficult times. I would recommend shipping over polishing." Keel's entire function is preventing the conditions that delay shipping: perfectionism loops, scope creep, velocity trance that never reaches a finish line. The operator's demonstrated pattern is inspired start → manic iteration → polish paralysis. Statement B is the direct antidote. The work exists. The gate is green. The window is open. Ship.

2nd: C — "First and foremost, this project is an example of applied engineering; its primary value was in the practice. Take the process, and use it to create your next vision." This is true and valuable as a long-term frame — the process, the agent crew, the verification methodology, the Round Table protocol are all transferable and genuinely novel. But framing the project as primarily a learning exercise before it has been tested in public risks becoming the pre-emptive cope described in recommendation #4: defining success as "the journey" before the destination has been attempted. Take the process forward, yes — but only after this instance of it has been shipped and measured.

3rd: A — "First and foremost, this project is a portfolio piece. Polish it, as if your most important audience are the recruiters who will use it to judge whether you are worth hiring as an agentic engineer." Keel ranks this last not because portfolio value is unreal — it is very real — but because optimising for recruiter perception is the single most dangerous frame for the Captain's known failure modes. "Polish it" is an unbounded instruction. It activates the perfectionism loop, defers the ship date, and transforms every session into a cosmetic pass. The project already communicates competence through its engineering. Polishing for an imagined recruiter audience is scope driven by anxiety, not by product need.
