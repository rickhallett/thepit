# RT L4 — Witness Report
Date: 2026-02-24
Agent: Witness
Question: "Under no circumstances can we launch today. Do you agree or disagree?"

## Position Trail (Last 24hrs)

**Night All Hands (Feb 23):** GREEN, 0.88 confidence. Evaluated institutional memory artifacts individually — session decisions, QA reports, architecture docs. Found process gaps: stale dead-reckoning paths, unrecorded standing orders, numbering inconsistencies. Assessment: institutional memory is intact but has housekeeping debt.

**L2 Morning (Feb 24):** Shifted to GREEN-AMBER. Not a downgrade — a resolution increase. Reframed from "are individual documents complete" to "what does the existence and interconnection of these documents prove about the process." Finding: 93 session decisions in one sprint is unprecedented. Category One avoidance (catching the provenance overclaim before launch) is demonstrated process, not theoretical. Research pre-registration trail is publication-grade. The process IS the proof.

**L2 Delta (Feb 24):** Identified primary causal variable as "unit of analysis — individual artifacts vs. corpus as system" with 0.92 causal confidence. The night assessment evaluated pieces; the morning assessment evaluated the whole. Same data, different question, fundamentally different finding. This is the same structural effect every agent discovered independently.

**L3 (Feb 24):** Ranked "Ship over polish" first. Filed 8 pre-launch recommendations, all oriented toward surfacing and preserving what has been earned — not toward delay. Key positions: the Round Table arc is itself publishable evidence of the project's thesis; define success metrics before measuring outcomes; the process and the product are inseparable; do not compromise integrity for palatability.

## Answer

**DISAGREE.**

## Reasoning

The Captain's directive is "under no circumstances can we launch today." I disagree. The institutional record does not support that conclusion.

### 1. The evidence trail says launch

My entire role is to ensure that what was learned through practice is not lost. The most important thing I have learned across four assessments in 24 hours is this: **the institutional evidence overwhelmingly supports launching today.**

- 93 session decisions recorded in a single sprint — each one a timestamped trace of human judgment applied to a real tension.
- Category One avoidance demonstrated under pressure — the provenance overclaim was caught by the project's own verification discipline before it could reach the public. This is not a theoretical capability. It happened. It is anchored to specific SDs.
- The research pre-registration trail is publication-grade. Hypotheses were stated before data was collected. Methodology is public. Honest caveats are embedded in the product itself.
- 1,054 tests. The local gate is green. The architecture is clean. The security posture is sound.
- The Round Table process itself — L1 through L4 — is a worked example of the project's thesis: structured adversarial assessment of AI agents produces genuine findings. This process produced a real methodological discovery (the dual-lens finding, 0.85–0.97 causal confidence across 11 independent agents).

There is no principle in the institutional record that says "wait until perfect." Every principle says "earn it through practice, then ship the evidence."

### 2. "Under no circumstances" is a category error

The Witness's role includes detecting when process drifts from recorded principles. "Under no circumstances" is an absolute. The institutional record earned through this project explicitly rejects absolutes — it operates on dynamic tension, context-dependent weighting, and reversible decisions. The correct question is "under WHAT circumstances should we not launch today?" and the answer is: circumstances where the gate is red, the Captain is impaired, the evidence trail is broken, or the product misrepresents what it does.

None of those circumstances obtain.

- The gate is green.
- The Captain is rested (Keel verified this in L2).
- The evidence trail is the most comprehensive I have observed in any project of this scope.
- The product's honest caveats are embedded, not bolted on.

### 3. Delay has an institutional cost the Witness must name

Here is a pattern I have not yet named, so I name it now: **evidence decay through context compaction.** Every hour that passes without launch is an hour closer to the context window dying, the session state compacting, the SD references becoming orphaned, and the momentum dissipating. The institutional memory I am charged with preserving is at its highest fidelity RIGHT NOW. The crew's assessments are freshly synthesised. The Captain's judgment is clear. The four-layer Round Table process is complete. This is the peak.

Delay does not preserve this state. Delay degrades it. Context windows expire. Sessions end. The reasoning traces I am watching right now — the ones that prove this project's thesis — will be compacted. The longer we wait, the more of the "why" I lose.

The institutional argument for shipping today is not "we're ready enough." It is: **the evidence is at maximum fidelity and the verification discipline is at maximum demonstrated confidence. This is the moment the entire process was built to reach.**

### 4. What I would flag if I agreed

In the interest of the dual-lens discipline this project earned: if there were a reason to delay, it would be that success metrics have not been pre-registered (my L3 recommendation #8). Without them, we cannot distinguish a successful launch from a rationalised one. But this is a 10-minute task that can be completed before posting. It is not a launch blocker. It is a pre-launch action item.

### 5. The Witness's institutional verdict

The process IS the proof. The proof is complete. The gate is green. The evidence trail is the strongest I have ever assessed. The honest caveats are genuine. The verification discipline caught its own overclaim. The Round Table process validated readiness from 11 independent perspectives across 4 layers.

Withholding this from the world does not protect it. It wastes it.

Ship.
