## Items

| # | Finding | Source | Detail | Action trigger |
|---|---------|--------|--------|----------------|
| N1 | `claude-sonnet-4-6` is a rolling model pointer | CodeRabbit nitpick, `lib/models.ts:56` | No date suffix means Anthropic could silently update model weights. Pin to dated snapshot (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6-YYYYMMDD`) when one is published. | Anthropic publishes a dated snapshot for Sonnet 4.6 |
| N4 | No test for anonymous-gets-Haiku behaviour | CodeRabbit nitpick, `tests/api/run-bout-tier.test.ts:420-426` | Old test 10 (anonymous + premium preset = 402) was removed when the anonymous premium path was stripped. New behaviour (anonymous always gets Haiku) is enforced by the engine but has no dedicated test. Requires `vi.doMock`/`resetModules` setup to test the `!SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED \|\| !userId` branch. | Next test coverage pass or if the anonymous model path is modified |
