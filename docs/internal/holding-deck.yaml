  - id: agent-attestation-roi
    idea: estimate ROI on extending the agent builder on thepit.cloud; attest this team of agents on chain in their current form, keep agent url + L2 ETH Base hash in file

  - id: governance-precedence-taxonomy
    idea: clear taxonomy of what trumps what (register vs provenance vs standing orders); unix file permissions as model — rich rubric, decades of service, proven at scale

  - id: hidden-html-nod

  - id: sd-onchain-attestation
    idea: >-
      Use pitnet (EAS on Base L2) to attest session decisions on-chain.
      TECHNICAL — pitnet already attests; extend schema to SD entries (id, decision, status, git-sha).
      SCOPE — batch attest on commit or per-SD; need schema registration (one-time gas), then ~$0.01/attestation at current L2 rates.
      VALUE-ADD — git already provides tamperproof commit history with GPG signing; on-chain adds
      (1) independence from GitHub as trust anchor,
      (2) public timestamp not dependent on git reflog integrity,
      (3) cross-repo attestation if SDs reference external artifacts,
      (4) composability with other on-chain provenance (agent attestations, content hashes).
      COUNTER — git + GPG + GitHub archive already solves 90pct of this; the remaining 10pct is valuable
      precisely when the content becomes contested or the repo is forked/deleted/rewritten.
      Blog post origin verification is the stronger use case — content hash on-chain at publish time
      proves what the page said before edits. Worth scoping as extension of existing pitnet infra, not a new system.
      FORGERY ASSESSMENT — for agent-article scenario (agent files on site, articles labelled by author agent,
      backlink to agent page), on-chain adds near-zero forgery protection beyond git. Attack vector already
      mitigated by commit history + signing. Value is as demonstration piece and linkable artifact, not shield.
      Frame as "heres how youd solve agentic content provenance" not "heres the protection."
      Research note or blog writeup showing 100 lines of Go on top of 119k base is the real artifact.

  - id: zombie-code-audit
    idea: >-
      Static analysis + LLM analysis + human review on 119k codebase.
      Three-pass sweep — (1) tooling pass with knip/ts-prune for dead exports, unused deps, unreachable code,
      (2) LLM pass for semantic zombies (functions that exist but are superseded, tests that assert tautologies,
      over-abstracted patterns that could be flattened), (3) Captain review on results.
      Scope is thepit.cloud app code (app/, lib/, components/, db/) and pit* Go CLIs.
      This is make-it-right after make-it-work. Failing to clean is hiring_signal=-1 —
      the thesis is disciplined agentic engineering, zombie code in the repo contradicts it at the artifact level.
      Output should be actionable report with file-level findings, not a vague "could be cleaner."
