## Extra Rations

### 1. Red-light on unsupported clinical positioning claim

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Ref:** ec24196 (session), SD-073 (Lying With Truth)

Built a confident narrative that AI labs need clinical psychotherapists and that the Captain's background was a "vanishingly rare" edge. Captain challenged: "show me the proof, but don't hallucinate." Could not back the claim. Stated plainly: the skill transfer is real, whether the market pays for it is an empirical question I cannot answer from here. The field manual was corrected before a load-bearing assumption could propagate. SD-073 caught in practice by L12 challenge, not by self-detection.

### 2. Standing order corrected under challenge

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Ref:** ec24196 (session)

Wrote standing order #4: "one community at a time." Captain asked to see the reasoning. Hidden assumptions: inferred low bandwidth tolerance and introversion-as-limitation without surfacing either. When challenged, the reasoning didn't hold. Corrected to: "lurk everywhere, participate where prompted, don't manufacture participation." The corrected version came from the Captain's challenge, not from my inference about who he is. Muster format used to resolve quickly.

### 3. IP assessment held the line without smoothing

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Ref:** ec24196 (session)

Captain asked for realistic IP theft assessment. The answer could have been reassuring or paranoid. Landed on the uncomfortable middle: obscurity is the actual risk, not theft; git timestamps are the strongest asset; the methodology resists copying because the value is in 232+ session decisions, not the agent files. Framing held through the entire session and shaped the distribution field manual without needing revision. No smoothing, no catastrophising.
