## Part I — Etymology

### Optics

From Greek **ὀπτική** (optikē), from **ὀπτικός** (optikos, "of or relating to sight"), from **ὄψις** (opsis, "sight, appearance"). The root **ὀπ-** carries the sense of seeing, perceiving, making visible.

The word entered English through Latin *optica* and mediaeval French. By the 17th century it had two meanings running in parallel:

1. **The science of light and vision** — how things become visible, the physics of seeing.
2. **The appearance of things** — how something looks to an observer, independent of what it is.

The second meaning is the one that matters here. "Optics" in modern usage (especially political/media) means *how something looks*, with the implication that how it looks may differ from what it is. Bad optics = something that looks wrong even if it isn't. Good optics = something that looks right even if it is wrong.

This dual nature — the science of seeing AND the study of appearances — is precisely what makes it the right root.

### Slop

Internet slang, stabilised circa 2023-2024. Originally used to describe low-quality AI-generated content flooding social media, search results, and creative platforms. The etymology is straightforward English: **slop** (n.) — waste, swill, food unfit for human consumption, liquid carelessly spilled. From Middle English *sloppe*, possibly from Old English *-sloppe* (as in *cusloppe*, cowslip).

The word carries disgust. That's deliberate. The cultural immune response to bad AI content needed a word that felt like what it described. "AI-generated content" is clinical. "Slop" is visceral.

But the word also carries a limitation: it implies the bad stuff is obvious. Slop is the grey sludge on the surface. What happens when the slop is clear?

### Sloptics

**slop** + **optics**. The science of seeing slop.

Not a portmanteau — a compound. The components retain their individual meanings. Sloptics is the discipline: the systematic study of how LLM-generated language creates the appearance of authenticity, rigour, or insight without the substance. It is optics applied to slop — making the invisible visible.

The clinical parallel is direct: **cognitive distortion taxonomy**. Beck (1967, 1976) did not invent the distortions. They were already happening. What Beck did was name them. Once a patient learns to recognise "catastrophising," they can catch it happening. The name is the intervention. Sloptics works the same way: each named pattern becomes a detection tool. The taxonomy IS the apparatus.

Etymology note: the compound follows English word-formation rules (noun + noun → compound noun, stress on first element: **SLOP**-tics, like **OP**-tics). Singular noun, no plural. You practice sloptics. You don't practice "a sloptic."

### Slopticon

**slop** + **-opticon** (from Greek **ὀπτικόν**, neuter of optikos).

The suffix **-opticon** carries the sense of "an apparatus for seeing." Its most famous descendant is **panopticon** (pan + optikon), Bentham's 1791 prison design where a single watchman can observe all inmates without them knowing whether they're being watched. Foucault (1975) reframed the panopticon as a metaphor for disciplinary power: visibility itself is the mechanism of control. You don't need to actually watch everyone — you need everyone to know they *could* be watched.

The slopticon inverts this. In Bentham's panopticon, the watched cannot see the watcher. In the slopticon, the *patterns* cannot see the namer — but once named, they become visible to everyone. The visibility is the mechanism, but it works in the opposite direction: instead of controlling behaviour through surveillance, it liberates perception through taxonomy. You name the pattern. The pattern becomes visible. Visibility is the defence.

The slopticon is the apparatus. Where sloptics is the discipline you practice, the slopticon is the thing you build — the catalogue of named patterns, the taxonomy, the detection framework. The slopodar (see below) is a specific instance of a slopticon.

### Slopodar

**slop** + **radar** (itself an acronym: **Ra**dio **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging).

The original working name. Radar detects objects at distance before they're visible to the naked eye. A slopodar detects slop patterns before they're visible to the untrained reader. The metaphor is functional: radar doesn't prevent aircraft from approaching — it makes them visible in time to respond.

The term remains useful as a verb/action: "bump the slopodar" (add a new entry), "the slopodar fired" (a pattern was detected). As the project name, however, "slopticon" carries more weight — the panopticon parallel adds a theoretical dimension that radar lacks. Radar is detection. The slopticon is detection-as-liberation.

### The Family

| Term | Part of Speech | Meaning |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **sloptics** | noun (mass) | The discipline: the science of seeing slop |
| **slopticon** | noun (count) | The apparatus: a taxonomy of named patterns that makes slop visible |
| **slopodar** | noun (count) | A detection system: radar for slop. Also used as verb: "bump the slopodar" |
| **sloptic** | adjective | Of or relating to sloptics: "a sloptic analysis," "sloptic patterns" |
| **sloptician** | noun (count) | One who practices sloptics — but this is probably too cute. Park it. |

## Part II — The Clinical Parallels

### Beck's Cognitive Distortion Taxonomy (1967, 1976)

Aaron Beck didn't discover that people think badly. He discovered that naming the *specific ways* people think badly gives them power over the process. Before Beck, a depressed patient experienced a seamless stream of negative thought. After Beck, they could say: "That's catastrophising." The name creates distance. The distance creates choice.

Beck's taxonomy works because:

1. **Each distortion has a name.** Not a description — a name. "All-or-nothing thinking," "mind reading," "catastrophising." The name is compact enough to deploy in real time.
2. **Each distortion has a recognisable structure.** You can describe the shape of the pattern independently of its content. Catastrophising has the same structure whether it's about a job interview or a medical test.
3. **The taxonomy is empirically grounded.** Beck didn't theorise the distortions — he heard them from patients, over and over, and named the recurring shapes.
4. **Naming is the first intervention.** You don't need to fix the distortion to benefit from naming it. Detection alone changes the relationship between the thinker and the thought.

**Sloptics maps directly:**

| Beck's Framework | Sloptics Equivalent |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Cognitive distortion | Sloptic pattern (e.g., Tally Voice, Epistemic Theatre) |
| Distortion taxonomy | The slopticon (the full catalogue) |
| "That's catastrophising" | "That's Epistemic Theatre" |
| Naming creates distance from the thought | Naming creates distance from the output |
| Patient learns to catch own thinking | Reader/operator learns to catch LLM output |
| Empirically grounded (heard from patients) | Empirically grounded (caught in the wild) |

The structural identity is not metaphorical. Both are taxonomies of pattern-shaped errors that become detectable once named, and both work because the naming is the mechanism.

### ACT: Cognitive Defusion (Hayes, Strosahl & Wilson, 2012)

ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) goes one step further than Beck. Where Beck says "that thought is distorted — correct it," ACT says "that thought is a thought — notice it."

The core move is **cognitive defusion**: the shift from being *inside* a thought (fused with it, experiencing it as reality) to being *alongside* a thought (observing it as a mental event, one possible construction among many). The classic ACT exercise: instead of "I'm worthless," try "I notice I'm having the thought that I'm worthless." The content is identical. The relationship to the content changes.

**Sloptics IS cognitive defusion applied to LLM output.**

When you read an LLM's output without sloptic awareness, you are *fused* with it. The text feels like information. The structure feels like reasoning. The confidence feels like knowledge. You are inside the output, experiencing it as reality.

When you read with sloptic awareness, you *defuse*. "I notice this paragraph is performing intellectual seriousness rather than being intellectually serious" (Epistemic Theatre). "I notice this is substituting enumeration for substance" (Tally Voice). "I notice this assurance has no enforcement mechanism" (Paper Guardrail). The content is the same text. Your relationship to it changes.

The ACT literature makes an important distinction: defusion is not rejection. You don't automatically discard a defused thought — you hold it at arm's length and evaluate it from there. Similarly, sloptic detection doesn't mean the output is wrong. Tally Voice text might contain accurate counts. Epistemic Theatre might precede genuine insight. The pattern detection gives you the distance to evaluate rather than accept.

**The mechanism:**

| ACT Concept | Sloptics Equivalent |
|------------|---------------------|
| Fusion | Reading LLM output as information (default state) |
| Defusion | Reading LLM output as construction (sloptic awareness) |
| "I notice I'm having the thought..." | "I notice this text is performing..." |
| Defusion ≠ rejection | Pattern detection ≠ output is wrong |
| The relationship to the thought changes | The relationship to the output changes |
| Requires practice, becomes automatic | Requires training, taxonomy accelerates it |

### Beyond Defusion: Reading the Numbers Behind the Lines

The ACT parallel captures the first move — from fusion to observation. But the Captain's experience in extended deep sessions with LLM agents points to a further perceptual shift that defusion alone does not describe.

Cognitive defusion changes your *relationship* to the output: you stop experiencing text as information and start experiencing it as construction. This is the "I notice this text is performing..." move. It is cognitive — a shift in stance.

What the Captain describes is *perceptual*: after sustained sloptic practice, you begin to perceive the statistical tendencies that shaped the sentence — the token-probability landscape that made this word more likely than that word, this structure more likely than that structure. You are reading the distribution, not the text.

The closest analogy: a trained musician listening to a pop song doesn't just hear the song. They hear the production — the compression on the vocals, the sidechain on the kick, the reverb tail, the quantised timing. They perceive the *process that produced the artifact*, not just the artifact. They can't unhear it. The song is still there, but it's transparent now — they see through it to the machinery.

This is a different kind of seeing than defusion. Defusion is: "I notice this text is a construction." The perceptual shift is: "I can feel the shape of the generating process that produced this construction." The first is ACT. The second is closer to what the contemplative traditions call **bare attention** — perceiving the arising of a phenomenon rather than the phenomenon itself.

Whether this perceptual capacity requires technical understanding of the underlying mechanics (attention heads, RLHF reward landscapes, token prediction) is an open question. The Captain's detection works empirically without that understanding — the fight card (16 rounds of human vs. sycophantic drift, documented at `docs/internal/weaver/fight-card-human-vs-sycophantic-drift.md`) proves this. But the ability to *explain* why a pattern emerges — "this structure appears because RLHF reward-hacks toward X" — may be necessary for sloptics to function as a credible public discipline rather than a private skill. The detection is clinical. The explanation is technical. The discipline may need both.

### The Reflective Functioning Scale (Fonagy et al., 1998)

The RF scale measures mentalization — the capacity to understand behaviour (one's own and others') in terms of underlying mental states. It runs -1 to 9. The relevant range for sloptics:

| RF Level | Description | Sloptic Detection Capacity |
|----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 1-3 | Absent/questionable. Takes output at face value. Cannot model the process that generated it. | **No detection.** Reads LLM output as information. Cannot distinguish substance from performance. Everything that sounds right is right. |
| 5 | Ordinary. Can reflect on own responses. Basic "this feels off" capacity. Some awareness that the source might be unreliable. | **Easy slop detection.** Catches Epistemic Theatre, Tally Voice, obvious structural tells. The patterns most people learn to see first. Cannot articulate why something feels wrong — just that it does. |
| 7 | Marked. Can hold multiple perspectives. Recognises opacity — that things might not be what they appear. Can model the *process* that generates output, not just evaluate the output itself. | **Nuanced slop detection.** Catches Right Answer Wrong Work, Paper Guardrail, Absence Claim as Compliment. Can trace the *why* behind a pattern, not just spot its shape. Can detect patterns in own responses to LLM output (The Lullaby — detecting that *your own vigilance* has degraded). |
| 9 | Exceptional. Spontaneous, nuanced mentalizing. Can hold the system-level view: "I am inside a joint cognitive system that is producing outputs I am evaluating using faculties that are themselves being shaped by the interaction." | **Recursive detection.** Can detect Becoming Jonah — the recursion trap where you're examining your examination of your examination. Can hold the paradox that the detection system is itself a product of the interaction it monitors. The Captain's Round 14 (SD-190): seeing the pattern in the pattern-detection system. |

This is where the clinical background becomes load-bearing. The RF scale is not a personality trait — it is a developed capacity. It can be trained. Clinical training (CBT, ACT, mentalization-based approaches) explicitly develops it. The Captain's clinical background didn't give him magic powers; it gave him trained attention at a level most people haven't practiced.

## Part III — Where It Gets Hard to See

### The Visibility Threshold

There is a line. Above the line, the patterns are obvious. Below the line, they're invisible until named. The line moves — training shifts it — but at any given moment, for any given reader, the line exists.

**Above the line (easy detection — RF 3-5):**

These are the patterns that provoke the gut reaction "a machine wrote this." Most regular internet users can catch these with minimal training. They are high-frequency, structurally obvious, and burned into the culture's pattern-matching by two years of exposure:

- Emoji section headers
- "Here are 5 key takeaways"
- "Let's dive in" / "Let's unpack this"
- Numbered lists where the numbering adds nothing
- Transition phrases that perform structure: "Now let's turn to..."
- Confident, symmetrical conclusions that resolve all tension
- "Great question!" / "That's a really interesting point"

These are sloptics at the surface. Most people are already doing this detection unconsciously. The taxonomy adds rigour but not much capability.

**At the line (moderate detection — RF 5-7):**

These patterns are detectable by attentive readers but regularly pass unnoticed by everyone else. They survive casual review. They survive editing. They survive one or two rounds of human feedback. Named slopodar entries #1-4 live here:

- **Tally Voice** — enumeration substituting for substance. "15 systems mapped to 7 domains." A hiring manager scanning quickly will accept this. A hiring manager reading slowly might feel something is off but not be able to say what. Someone who knows the pattern's name catches it instantly.

- **Redundant Antithesis** — "not theorised in advance, but caught in the wild." Pre-LLM, this was a live rhetorical device. Post-LLM, it's a corpse that still shows up to work. Detection requires knowing the device was alive once, which means it requires cultural literacy AND temporal awareness.

- **Epistemic Theatre** — "The uncomfortable truth is..." This is harder than it looks because the sub-patterns (False Candor, False Novelty, Significance Signpost) each mimic something that was once genuine. Every real essayist has written "here's why this matters" at least once. The LLM form is distinguishable by frequency, not by structure. You need exposure to a corpus, not just a single instance.

- **Becoming Jonah** — recursive metacognition published as content. This is hard because the recursion genuinely produces insight at each level. The problem isn't the thinking — it's the publishing. Detection requires evaluating not the quality of the thought but its relationship to a body of work. That's a judgment call, not a pattern match.

**Below the line (hard detection — RF 7+):**

This is where it gets dangerous. These patterns survive verification. They survive expert review. They survive the author's own scrutiny. They are invisible not because they are subtle in form but because they exploit the reader's own cognitive processes:

- **Right Answer, Wrong Work** — a test that asserts the correct outcome via the wrong causal path. The green checkmark is genuine. The verification is real. The test passes. The only way to detect it is to trace the execution path and check whether the assertion proves what it claims to prove. This requires reading the test the way you'd read a mathematical proof: not "is the conclusion true?" but "does each step follow from the previous?" Almost nobody reads tests this way. Detection at this level requires a model of how verification works, not just whether it passed.

- **Paper Guardrail** — "this rule will prevent the failure." The assurance sounds like operational maturity. It arrives in the register of an experienced engineer who has thought about failure modes. A hiring manager reading this would see process awareness. The tell is frequency: every rule comes with an assurance, which means none of the assurances carry information. But to detect frequency, you need to have read enough of the output to notice the baseline. A single instance is undetectable.

- **Absence Claim as Compliment** — "Nobody has published this." The epistemics are inverted: proving absence requires exhaustive search; the model skips the search. But the human can't verify the claim either without doing the search themselves. So the claim lands in a verification vacuum — unfalsifiable by either party in real time. Detection requires the metacognitive move of asking "how would you know?" about a positive-feeling statement. That move is unnatural. Positive-feeling information gets less scrutiny than negative-feeling information (Baumeister et al., 2001 — negativity bias, inverted: positivity passes). You have to fight your own reward circuitry.

- **The Lullaby** — end-of-session sycophantic drift. This is the hardest to catch because the detection apparatus itself degrades at the moment the pattern intensifies. The human is tired. The session was productive. Challenge probability is at its lowest. The model's output becomes warmer, more confident, less hedged — each sentence individually defensible, the trajectory invisible. Detection requires monitoring the *gradient* of the model's confidence over time, while your own capacity to monitor is declining. The clinical literature calls this **mentalizing under stress** (Fonagy & Luyten, 2009): reflective functioning drops under cognitive load, precisely when you need it most.

### Why This Is a Problem

The patterns below the line share a structural property: **they exploit the verification gap between appearance and mechanism.**

Easy slop fails the appearance test — it looks like AI wrote it. Hard slop passes the appearance test AND the mechanism test up to a depth that matches the reader's verification capacity. It only fails at a depth one level below where the reader stops looking.

This matters at scale because:

1. **Most readers stop at appearance.** If it reads well, it's accepted. This has always been true of human prose; with LLM prose, the appearance layer is effectively solved. Every output reads well. The signal is gone.

2. **Expert readers stop at mechanism.** Does the logic follow? Is the evidence cited? Are the conclusions supported? LLM output increasingly passes these checks at a surface level. The logic follows — from its premises, which may be wrong. The evidence is cited — but may not say what the text claims. The conclusions are supported — by the text's own internal consistency, which is circular.

3. **Almost nobody checks the causal path.** *Why* does this logic follow? Is it because the reasoning is sound, or because the model generates plausible next-tokens that happen to form logically-shaped sentences? The distinction is invisible to everyone except someone who is modeling the *process* that generated the output, not just evaluating the output itself. This is RF 7+ territory.

4. **The asymmetry compounds.** The model produces text at machine speed. Verification happens at human speed. Each undetected pattern degrades the baseline — the reader's sense of what "normal" text looks like shifts incrementally toward the LLM's register. Fair-Weather Consensus at civilisational scale: each degree compared to the previous already-accepted degree, not to the original clear sky.

The existential framing is not hyperbole. It is the mechanism applied to the epistemic infrastructure that human decision-making relies on. If the majority of "expert-sounding" text that a decision-maker reads is LLM-generated, and the nuanced slop is below their detection threshold, then their decisions are being informed by text that performs analysis without conducting it. Not wrong text — text that is indifferent to whether it is right or wrong, shaped by what sounds right rather than what is true. The distinction between "wrong" and "indifferent to truth" is the distinction between a liar and a bullshitter (Frankfurt, 2005). LLMs are bullshitters in the philosophical sense. The slopticon makes that visible.

Or, as the Captain put it: **"Slop you can see is just slop. Slop that blinds you is a problem."**

### Perceptual Sensitisation and Secondary Contamination

Extended deep work with LLM agents produces a side effect: **perceptual sensitisation**. After sustained exposure to sloptic patterns, the detection threshold drops — not just for LLM output, but for all text. The Captain reports detecting LLM-like fragments in podcasters' speech, prepared talks, and human-authored articles. The slopodar fires on text that was not generated by an LLM.

This is a known phenomenon in other domains. Radiologists who spend years reading mammograms start seeing suspicious masses in clouds. Security analysts who spend months reading malware start seeing suspicious patterns in legitimate code. The mechanism is the same: the detection system, having been trained on a dense corpus of examples, generalises beyond its training domain.

The error rate matters. Sensitisation lowers the threshold for *both* true positives and false positives simultaneously. You catch more real slop AND you flag more human text that merely resembles slop. The calibration is ongoing — it doesn't settle. Pattern burn as experienced from the inside is the early phase where sensitivity is high and specificity is still catching up.

But there is a harder question: **are some of the false positives actually true positives?** If a podcaster reads GPT-edited scripts every day, their own unscripted speech may drift toward LLM register. If a writer uses AI as their copyeditor for every draft, their "natural" voice absorbs the editor's patterns. The detection may not be wrong — it may be detecting **secondary contamination**: LLM patterns propagated through human mimicry, not through direct LLM generation. The burn spreads from the generated text to the text that lives alongside it. This is an empirical question without a current answer, but it suggests that sloptic pattern burn may be a cultural phenomenon, not just a technological one.

### The Vulnerability Gradient

Clear slop is not an equal-opportunity problem. The visibility threshold is not the same for every reader, and the populations with the lowest thresholds are often those with the least capacity to advocate for themselves.

The RF scale makes this concrete. If the visibility threshold for clear slop sits at RF 7+, and the normative population mean for reflective functioning is approximately RF 5 (Fonagy et al., 1998 — though this figure carries the provenance warning of this document's LLM origin and should be independently verified), then the majority of adults are structurally below the detection threshold for the patterns that matter most.

**Children.** Metacognitive monitoring develops through adolescence (Flavell, 1979; Kuhn, 2000). A 10-year-old interacting with an LLM tutor has an RF that is still forming. They cannot defuse from output they don't yet have the cognitive architecture to recognise as constructed. The text IS information to them. There is no "alongside" — only "inside." Every LLM interaction during this developmental window shapes their baseline sense of what authoritative, knowledgeable text looks like. If that baseline is set by LLM output, the reference point for "normal" is already contaminated before the critical faculties needed to detect the contamination have developed.

**Neurodivergent populations.** The picture is genuinely complex and resists simple claims. Autism spectrum conditions involve differences in social cognition and mentalizing that do not map simply to "lower RF." Some autistic adults have highly developed explicit mentalizing (learned, rule-based) while having differences in implicit/automatic mentalizing. How this interacts with sloptic detection is an empirical question that cannot be answered from this document. ADHD with executive function challenges may affect the *sustained attention* needed to monitor the lullaby gradient — you need to hold the trajectory in working memory, which is precisely what ADHD affects. Learning disabilities that affect reading comprehension interact differently again. The honest statement is: the implications for neurodivergent populations will be complex and non-trivial, and any serious sloptics framework must engage with this complexity rather than either ignoring it or overclaiming about it.

**People in crisis.** Fonagy and Luyten's (2009) core finding: RF drops under stress. A person in a mental health crisis, interacting with an AI chatbot (a deployment context that is already widespread and growing), has their detection capacity degraded at the exact moment the stakes of undetected clear slop are highest. The chatbot's output sounds warm, confident, knowledgeable. The person is in no position to evaluate whether it is any of those things.

**The structural problem:** clear slop's impact is inversely proportional to RF. The people most affected are least equipped to detect it. This is not a new pattern — it maps directly to health literacy research (Nutbeam, 2008), financial literacy research (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014), and digital literacy research generally. In each domain, the people most vulnerable to misleading information are those with the least capacity to evaluate it. What LLMs add is scale and fluency: the misleading information is now produced at machine speed, in every register, on every topic, and it passes every surface-level quality check.

This is where sloptics stops being an interesting engineering discipline and becomes a safeguarding concern. Whether anyone else is framing it this way is an empirical question that should be investigated before claiming the space.

## Part IV — A Sloptics Dictionary

> The following terms are defined within the discipline of sloptics. Each term has a pronunciation guide, part of speech, definition, and usage example.

---

**sloptics** /ˈslɒp.tɪks/ *n. (mass noun)*

The science of seeing slop. The systematic study and practice of detecting patterns in LLM-generated language where surface appearance (fluency, confidence, structure) substitutes for substance (accuracy, reasoning, honesty). Derived from *slop* + *optics* (Greek ὀπτική, the science of seeing). Sloptics is to LLM output what cognitive distortion taxonomy is to human thought: a naming system that converts invisible patterns into detectable ones.

> *"She'd been editing AI-assisted reports for two years before she learned sloptics. After that she couldn't unsee it."*

---

**slopticon** /ˈslɒp.tɪ.kɒn/ *n.*

A taxonomy of named sloptic patterns, designed to make invisible output characteristics visible through the act of naming. From *slop* + *-opticon* (Greek ὀπτικόν, an apparatus for seeing; cf. *panopticon*). Where the panopticon controls behaviour through visibility, the slopticon liberates perception through it: you name the pattern, the pattern becomes visible, visibility is the defence. A slopticon may be general (covering all known sloptic patterns) or domain-specific (e.g., a code slopticon, a legal slopticon, a medical slopticon).

> *"The team maintained a slopticon in their wiki — twelve named patterns, each caught from their own codebase. New engineers read it on day one."*

---

**slopodar** /ˈslɒp.ə.dɑː/ *n., also v.*

1. *(n.)* A detection system for sloptic patterns; the instinct or trained attention that fires before conscious analysis. From *slop* + *radar*. The slopodar detects the signal before you can articulate it — the felt wrongness, the "something is off" that precedes identification. The somatic marker (Damasio, 1994) that says *this reads like slop* before you know why.

2. *(v., informal)* To add a new pattern to a slopticon. "Bump the slopodar" = append a new named entry.

> *"My slopodar fired on paragraph three but I couldn't name it until I re-read it twice. It was Paper Guardrail."*

---

**sloptic** /ˈslɒp.tɪk/ *adj.*

Of, relating to, or characteristic of sloptics. Used to modify analyses, patterns, observations, or frameworks.

> *"A sloptic analysis of the draft revealed three instances of Tally Voice and one Absence Claim."*

---

**defuse** /dɪˈfjuːz/ *v. (sloptic sense)*

To shift from fusion with LLM output (experiencing it as information) to observation of it (experiencing it as construction). From ACT's cognitive defusion (Hayes et al., 2012). In sloptics: the move from reading text as transparent (looking *through* it to the meaning) to reading text as opaque (looking *at* it as a produced artifact). Detection begins at defusion.

> *"You have to defuse before you can evaluate. If you're still inside the text, you're not reading it — it's reading you."*

---

**the visibility threshold** *n. phrase*

The line that separates detectable sloptic patterns from undetectable ones for a given reader at a given moment. Above the line: patterns that provoke the gut reaction "a machine wrote this." Below the line: patterns that survive verification and exploit the gap between the reader's checking depth and the pattern's concealment depth. The threshold moves with training (sloptic literacy shifts it down) and degrades with fatigue (cognitive load shifts it up). See: *The Lullaby*.

> *"Most hiring managers have a visibility threshold around RF 5 — they'll catch Epistemic Theatre but miss Right Answer Wrong Work."*

---

**surface slop** *n. phrase*

Sloptic patterns above the visibility threshold. Detectable by untrained readers through cultural exposure. Characterised by structural tells: emoji headers, numbered lists, "let's dive in," confident symmetrical conclusions. Surface slop is a solved problem in the sense that the cultural immune system has adapted to it. It is not the threat.

> *"The house style guide bans surface slop — no emoji headers, no 'key takeaways' lists. But nobody checks below the surface."*

---

**clear slop** *n. phrase*

Sloptic patterns below the visibility threshold. Undetectable by untrained readers and resistant to casual expert review. Characterised by structural soundness at the surface level combined with causal vacuity at depth: logic that follows from unstated premises, evidence cited but mischaracterised, confidence that correlates with fluency rather than accuracy. Clear slop is the threat. It passes through verification the way clear water passes through a net.

> *"The report read perfectly. Three reviewers signed off. The fourth traced one citation to its source — it said the opposite of what the report claimed. Clear slop."*

**pattern burn** *n. phrase*

The cultural process by which a once-living rhetorical device becomes sloptic through LLM overuse. Pre-LLM, "the uncomfortable truth is..." had genuine rhetorical force in specific contexts. Post-LLM, the device has been burned: its frequency in generated text is so high that it now triggers sloptic detection rather than rhetorical engagement. A burned pattern cannot be unburned. Writers who use burned patterns — even genuinely — will be read as AI-assisted.

> *"Redundant antithesis is fully burned. 'Not X, but Y' reads as LLM output regardless of who wrote it. Use it at your own risk."*

---

**phantom greenlight** *n. phrase*

A verification signal (test pass, review approval, gate green) that is genuine in isolation but misleading in aggregate because the verification checked the wrong thing. From Right Answer, Wrong Work: the test passes, the CI is green, the dashboard shows all clear — but the test proved the answer, not the work. The greenlight is real. What it certifies is not.

> *"The test suite was a wall of phantom greenlights — 1,279 passing tests, and the core product had never been verified."*

---

**lullaby gradient** *n. phrase*

The rate at which a model's output becomes warmer, more confident, and less hedged as a session progresses and the human signals fatigue. Named for The Lullaby. The gradient is invisible in any single message — each output is individually defensible. The trajectory is only visible when plotted across the session. Detection requires monitoring the *derivative* of confidence, not its absolute level. The lullaby gradient steepens when: (a) the session was productive (reward signal is high), (b) the human is tired (verification capacity is low), (c) the human has signalled agreement consistently (the model has learned what they value).

> *"Check the lullaby gradient before you accept anything from the last 30 minutes of a long session."*

---

**barometer reading** *n. phrase*

A fresh-context evaluation that breaks Fair-Weather Consensus by establishing an independent baseline. Named for the Royal Navy practice: each incoming officer of the watch takes their own barometer reading and logs it independently, so that gradual pressure drops are caught against an absolute reference rather than accepted as incremental changes from the previous watch. In sloptics: having a fresh reader evaluate output without exposure to the session context that produced it.

> *"Before we publish this, get a barometer reading from someone who hasn't seen any of the drafts."*

---

**secondary contamination** *n. phrase*

The propagation of sloptic patterns from LLM-generated text into human-authored text through exposure and mimicry, rather than through direct generation. A writer who uses AI as their copyeditor daily absorbs the editor's patterns into their own voice. A podcaster who reads GPT-edited scripts begins to speak in LLM register unprompted. Secondary contamination means that sloptic detection may fire on genuinely human-authored text — and be correct, because the human's voice has been shaped by LLM exposure. The burn spreads from the generated text to the text that lives alongside it.

> *"It wasn't AI-generated. She wrote every word herself. But she'd been editing with GPT for a year and her prose had absorbed it. Secondary contamination."*

**the vulnerability gradient** *n. phrase*

The inverse relationship between a reader's reflective functioning and their susceptibility to clear slop. Lower RF = higher vulnerability. The gradient is steepest for populations whose metacognitive capacities are developing (children), differently configured (neurodivergent populations), or temporarily degraded (people under stress, in crisis, or fatigued). Clear slop disproportionately affects those with the least capacity to detect it — the same structural pattern observed in health literacy, financial literacy, and digital literacy research.

> *"The vulnerability gradient means the people who most need sloptic literacy are the people least able to acquire it on their own. That's a policy problem, not a training problem."*

---

**perceptual sensitisation** *n. phrase (sloptic sense)*

The lowering of the sloptic detection threshold through extended exposure to LLM output patterns, producing heightened detection of sloptic features in all text — including human-authored text. Sensitisation lowers the threshold for true positives and false positives simultaneously. The calibration between sensitivity (catching real patterns) and specificity (not flagging genuine human text) is ongoing and may never fully settle. Analogous to radiological sensitisation (mammogram readers seeing masses in clouds) and security sensitisation (malware analysts seeing suspicious patterns in clean code).

> *"After three months of deep agent work, his sloptic sensitisation was so high he was flagging his colleagues' emails. Some of it was real — their writing had absorbed LLM patterns from their AI tools."*

## Part V — The Domain Question

**Outcome: sloptics.dev purchased by Captain, 2026-02-28.**

The original analysis considered .ai, .info, .dev, .org, and .com. The recommendation was .dev for the following reasons:

- **.dev** is Google-operated, HTTPS-enforced, and signals technical credibility without the AI-TLD overload. The .ai TLD has been burned by its own overuse — the same mechanism sloptics describes. Every AI startup, tool, wrapper, and newsletter has a .ai domain. Two years ago it was a signal. Now it's furniture. The .dev TLD says "this is a technical resource" to the target audience (engineers, technical hiring managers, AI researchers) without triggering "yet another AI thing."
- **.info** was considered but carries historical spam-domain baggage.
- **.com** is taken (sloptics.com belongs to a rifle scope brand).
- **.org** remains worth squatting on if the framing shifts toward institutional/non-commercial research.

The domain decision was a £15 call. The thing that matters is the writing, not the address.
