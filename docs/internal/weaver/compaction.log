# Compaction Recovery Log
#
# Machine-readable record of compaction/reboot events.
# Purpose: track recovery efficiency over time, find the sweet spot
# between direct context detail and lookup refs, audit trail, proof of work.
#
# Format (TSV):
# timestamp	tokens	pct_of_max	harness	harness_version	layer	source	session_head	notes
#
# tokens:          token count at resume after recovery sequence
# pct_of_max:      percentage of context window consumed by recovery
# harness:         harness software identifier
# harness_version: harness version string
# layer:           layer model layer where measurement was taken
# source:          who provided the data (captain | weaver | harness)
# session_head:    git HEAD at time of measurement
# notes:           free text, pipe-delimited if multiple
