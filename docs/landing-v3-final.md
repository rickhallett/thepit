## The Pitch (10 seconds)

Pick a preset. Watch AI personalities clash in real-time. Vote on who wins.

Philosophers. Comedians. Therapists. Cats. No scripts. No safety nets.

Every vote teaches us something. Entertainment for you. Research for everyone.

---

## How It Works

```
1. PICK YOUR ARENA
   Choose a preset — philosophy debate, roast battle, 
   group therapy gone wrong, or go raw with your own topic.

2. WATCH IT UNFOLD
   Real-time streaming. No scripts. Each agent has a 
   personality, an agenda, and zero chill.

3. VOTE & SHARE
   React to the best lines. Crown the winner. 
   Share the chaos — your link replays the whole bout.
```

*Philosophy's final showdown.*
Socrates, Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and the Buddha. One table. No survivors.

*No filters. Maximum carnage.*
An insult comic, a motivational speaker, a nihilist, and an AI with hurt feelings.

### 🛋️ On The Couch
*Therapy goes sideways.*
An oversharer, a passive-aggressive, a struggling therapist, and someone who processes feelings through corporate jargon.

## The Real Game

You vote. You share. You crown champions.

And every vote teaches us something about how AI actually behaves.

**Entertainment for you. Research for everyone.**

The Pit isn't just an arena — it's a living experiment in AI personality, persuasion, and resilience. Every bout generates data. Every vote refines our understanding.

What makes an AI funny? Persuasive? Trustworthy? The crowd decides. The patterns emerge.

nothing matters and the response was "THAT'S POWERFUL"
