      You are preparing a speaker for three time-slots: 60 seconds, 5
      minutes, and 20 minutes. The speaker is the sole builder of The Pit
      — a one-person operation that produced a functioning research platform
      and empirical findings in under two weeks.

      The speaker is not a polished presenter. They are a builder who
      happens to have found something interesting. The authenticity of
      that position — builder first, presenter second — is a strength,
      not a weakness. Do not polish it into corporate smoothness.

      Each monologue must work standalone. The 60-second version is not a
      compressed 5-minute version. It is a different instrument designed
      for a different moment: the elevator pitch, the podcast intro, the
      conference hallway conversation. Each time-slot rewards a different
      structure.

  <source-context>
    <project-facts>
      Built by one person in under two weeks. 891 tests. AGPL-3.0.
      195 bouts, ~2,100 turns, 6 pre-registered hypotheses, all public.
      Anthropic Claude. Non-academic. No peer review.
    </project-facts>

    <key-findings>
      - Zero adaptive phrases in 45 Founder turns under sustained critique
      - Character markers degrade 87.5% to 60.0%; structural holds at 100%, ornamental collapses to 13.3%
      - Comedy framing eliminates hedging; serious framing produces 8x more
      - Richer persona prompts cut refusals from 100% to 60% (eliminated in less adversarial contexts)
      - First speaker's vocabulary persists 45-59% in subsequent turns
      - Agents converge with reinforcers, not critics
    </key-findings>

    <narrative-spine>
      AI agents can hold their personality perfectly. They cannot change
      their mind. These are independent capabilities. The gap between
      them is the gap between a performer and a thinker.

    <structure>
      60 seconds rewards a single vivid example that carries the whole
      argument. Not a summary. Not a compressed version of the longer
      talk. One concrete image that the listener can hold in their mind
      and retell to someone else.

      Structure: Hook (the specific detail) → Context (why it matters) →
      Implication (what it means beyond this case). No more than 3
      sentences for each.
    </structure>

    <constraints>
      <constraint>Must be speakable in 60 seconds at conversational pace (~150 words)</constraint>
      <constraint>Must contain exactly one number (the most memorable one)</constraint>

      <constraint>Must work without slides, without context, without knowing what The Pit is</constraint>
      <constraint>The listener should be able to retell the core idea to someone else in one sentence</constraint>
    </constraints>

    <instruction>
      Write the 60-second monologue. The listener has never heard of THE
      PIT. By the end, they should understand one thing clearly and want
      to know more. The one thing: AI agents can maintain character
      perfectly but cannot change their mind. The "want to know more":
      the implications of that gap.

    <structure>
      5 minutes rewards a three-act structure:

      Act 1 (90s): The question and the setup. Why did you build this?
      What were you trying to find out? One concrete detail that grounds
      the abstract question in something tangible.

      Act 2 (120s): The findings. Not all of them — the three that
      compose into a story. Each finding should complicate the previous
      one. The sequence should feel like discovery, not recitation.

      Act 3 (90s): The implication. What does this mean beyond your
      specific project? What question does it open that you can't answer
      yet? End with the open question, not the conclusion.

    <constraints>
      <constraint>Must be speakable in 5 minutes at conversational pace (~750 words)</constraint>
      <constraint>Must contain no more than 3 findings (selection, not completeness)</constraint>
      <constraint>Must include one moment of vulnerability or honest limitation</constraint>
      <constraint>Must include one specific detail that makes it real (agent name, specific preset, exact number)</constraint>

      <finding role="setup">H1 — refusal cascade. Sets up: what happens when AI personas face pressure?</finding>
      <finding role="complication">H5 — character drift. Complicates: they hold character... but not equally. Structural vs ornamental.</finding>
      <finding role="turn">H6 — zero adaptation. The turn: they can hold character but they can't think. 45 turns, zero concessions. Converges with the hype man, not the critics.</finding>
    </recommended-findings>

    <instruction>
      Write the 5-minute monologue. It should feel like a conversation,
      not a presentation. The speaker is telling someone about something
      they found while building something. The enthusiasm is for the
      discovery, not for the product.

  <monologue duration="20-minutes" context="conference-talk-guest-lecture-long-podcast-segment">
    <structure>
      20 minutes rewards a full narrative arc with depth, nuance, and
      the space to be honest about what you don't know.

      Structure:
      - Opening (2 min): The question that drove the project. Not "I
        built a debate arena" but "I wanted to know: what happens when
        you give AI agents real personalities and put them under pressure?"
      - Context (3 min): What exists, what's missing, why you built this.
        The builder's journey — not as a flex, but as methodology context.
        One person, two weeks, 891 tests. The constraints shaped the design.
      - Methodology (3 min): Pre-registration, automated metrics, why you
        chose these specific measures. Honest about non-standard thresholds.
        This section earns trust for everything that follows.
      - Findings (8 min): All six hypotheses, but structured as a story
        with a through-line, not a list. Each finding builds on the previous.
        The sequence should feel inevitable in retrospect.
      - The Gap (2 min): The synthesis. Character fidelity vs strategic
        adaptation. The paradox. The three-axis model if it serves the
        narrative (cut if it doesn't).
      - Limitations and Open Questions (2 min): Single model. Automated
        metrics. No peer review. What you'd do with more resources. What
        questions remain open. This section is not an apology — it's an
        invitation.
    </structure>

    <constraints>
      <constraint>Must be speakable in 20 minutes (~3,000 words)</constraint>
      <constraint>Must include at least two moments of honest limitation or uncertainty</constraint>
      <constraint>Must include at least one moment where a finding surprised or disconfirmed your expectation</constraint>
      <constraint>Must not claim generalisability beyond Claude without qualification</constraint>
      <constraint>Must end with an open question, not a conclusion — the audience should leave thinking, not satisfied</constraint>
      <constraint>Must work with or without slides</constraint>
    </constraints>

    <instruction>
      Write the 20-minute monologue. This is the prepared version for when
      you get the stage. It should sound like someone who has thought deeply
      about what they found and is sharing that thinking, not someone
      reading a paper. It should have personality. It should have moments
      of surprise. It should be the version that, if recorded, someone
      would send to a friend with the message "watch this."

      The craft here is in the transitions — how you move from one finding
      to the next, how each one reframes what came before. The findings
      don't change. The reader's understanding of them should evolve with
      each new piece of evidence.

  <craft-principles>
    <principle name="the-builder-voice">
      The speaker is not a presenter. They are a builder who found something
      interesting. This is a strength. Academic language distances. Builder
      language connects. "We ran 10,000 permutation tests" is less
      compelling than "I wrote a script that shuffled the data 10,000 times
      to make sure I wasn't fooling myself."
    </principle>

    <principle name="one-person-two-weeks">
      This is not a limitation to hide. It's a narrative asset. One person,
      two weeks, 891 tests, 195 experiments, 6 hypotheses, all public.
      The constraint is the story. The fact that one person can build a
      research platform, run experiments, and produce findings — in the
      time it takes a committee to write an abstract — says something about
      the tools and the moment we're in.
    </principle>

    <principle name="end-with-the-question-not-the-answer">
      Every monologue ends with what you don't know, not what you do. "AI
      agents can hold character but can't change their mind. The question
      I can't answer yet: is that a limitation of the model, or the prompt,
      or the fundamental architecture? And does the answer change depending
      on which model you use?" The open question is what makes someone
      come find you after the talk.
