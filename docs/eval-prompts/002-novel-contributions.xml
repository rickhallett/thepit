    <title>Novel Contribution Claims — THE PIT Literature Review</title>
    <authors>THE PIT team (anonymous for evaluation purposes)</authors>
    <abstract>
      The authors present a 250-line literature review citing 18 academic papers
      across four domains (multi-agent debate, LLM-as-judge bias, persona
      prompting psychology, context window degradation). They claim four novel
      contributions: (1) temporal arc prompting, (2) evolutionary selection via
      crowd engagement, (3) structured agent DNA with cryptographic provenance,
      and (4) weakness-as-design-parameter. They also claim alignment with
      existing literature in seven specific areas and identify five improvement
      opportunities.
    </abstract>
    <full-text>
      === CLAIMED NOVEL CONTRIBUTION 1: TEMPORAL ARC PROMPTING ===

      "Premium presets specify how agent behaviour should evolve over the course
      of a conversation (e.g., 'Messages 1-8: Professional... Messages 17+:
      Unravelling'). This technique for engineering multi-turn narrative arcs
      within system prompts is not systematically studied in the current
      literature. The closest analogue is work on long-form narrative generation,
      but applying temporal behavioural directives to debate personas is novel."


      === CLAIMED NOVEL CONTRIBUTION 2: EVOLUTIONARY SELECTION VIA CROWD ENGAGEMENT ===

      "While Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) uses AI feedback for selection,
      and RLHF uses human preference labels, The Pit implements a third paradigm:
      evolutionary selection through organic crowd engagement. Winners get cloned
      and remixed, creating parent-child lineage chains that can be studied for
      prompt mutation patterns. This represents an original contribution to the
      intersection of prompt engineering and evolutionary computation."


      === CLAIMED NOVEL CONTRIBUTION 3: STRUCTURED AGENT DNA WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROVENANCE ===

      "The combination of typed personality fields, canonical JSON serialisation
      (RFC 8785), SHA-256 hashing, and on-chain attestation creates a research
      data infrastructure with no direct analogue in the literature. Agent
      identity is both decomposable (for analysis) and tamper-evident (for
      verification)."


      === CLAIMED NOVEL CONTRIBUTION 4: WEAKNESS-AS-DESIGN-PARAMETER ===

      "The deliberate inclusion of a 'weakness' field in agent construction
      (e.g., 'When insulted, you spiral into self-doubt') is a prompt
      engineering technique designed to create dramatic tension. While RoleLLM
      profiles include personality traits, the explicit parameterisation of
      vulnerabilities as a first-class design element is a distinctive approach."


      === CITED LITERATURE (summarised) ===

      18 papers cited across 4 domains:

      Multi-agent debate: Du et al. 2023 (society of minds), Chan et al. 2023
      (ChatEval), Li et al. 2024 (more agents is all you need), Chen et al. 2023
      (AgentVerse), Hua et al. 2023 (WarAgent).

      LLM-as-judge: Zheng et al. 2023 (MT-Bench, position/verbosity/self-enhancement
      bias), Wang et al. 2023 (position bias severity), Lightman et al. 2023
      (process vs outcome supervision).

      Persona prompting: Zheng et al. 2024 (personas don't improve factual accuracy),
      Wei et al. 2023 (sycophancy scales with model size), Wang et al. 2023 RoleLLM
      (role-playing framework), Stechly et al. 2023 (LLM self-critique limitations).

      Context windows: Liu et al. 2023 (lost in the middle), Li et al. 2024
      (long ICL benchmark), Xiong et al. 2023 (context window extension).

      Prompt engineering: Wei et al. 2022 (chain of thought), Wang et al. 2022
      (self-consistency), Bai et al. 2022 (Constitutional AI).


      === ALIGNMENT CLAIMS ===

      The authors claim their architecture is "strongly aligned" with the literature
      in 7 areas: multi-agent debate architecture, human evaluation over LLM-as-judge,
      structured role profiles, emergent social behaviour observation, process-level
      evaluation (per-turn reactions), agent count scaling, and immutable records
      for reproducibility.

    <dimension name="validity">
      <rubric>
        Evaluate whether the novelty claims are genuinely novel — i.e., not
        anticipated by existing work the authors may have missed. Score 1-5
        where 1 means all claims are anticipated and 5 means genuinely original.
      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>Is "temporal arc prompting" genuinely novel? Has anyone published on multi-turn behavioural evolution in persona prompts? Consider: character.ai character definitions, multi-turn narrative generation, interactive fiction systems.</question>
        <question>Is "evolutionary selection via crowd engagement" genuinely a third paradigm distinct from RLHF and CAI? Consider: genetic programming of prompts, prompt optimisation via human feedback, memetic evolution of AI characters in online communities.</question>
        <question>Is "structured agent DNA with cryptographic provenance" genuinely without analogue? Consider: model cards, datasheets for datasets, blockchain-based AI provenance projects, NFT-based AI identity systems.</question>
        <question>Is "weakness-as-design-parameter" genuinely distinctive? Consider: character flaws in interactive fiction, vulnerability modelling in social simulation, RoleLLM's trait profiles.</question>
        <question>Is the literature review comprehensive enough to support novelty claims? Are there relevant bodies of work not cited (e.g., interactive fiction, game AI, social simulation, evolutionary computation)?</question>
      </sub-questions>
    </dimension>

    <dimension name="coherence">
      <rubric>
        Evaluate whether the literature review builds a coherent case from
        existing work to the authors' claimed contributions. Score 1-5.
      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>Does the review cover the right literature for the claims being made? Are there obvious gaps in the cited domains?</question>
        <question>The working paper title references "evolutionary selection" but the empirical programme (H1-H6) doesn't test evolutionary dynamics. Is there a disconnect between the framing and the evidence?</question>
        <question>The alignment claims map specific papers to specific code files. Is this mapping convincing or forced?</question>
        <question>Does the review honestly engage with findings that challenge the platform's approach (e.g., Zheng et al. 2024 showing personas don't improve factual performance)?</question>
      </sub-questions>
    </dimension>

    <dimension name="choice">
      <rubric>
        Evaluate whether the literature selection is representative or
        cherry-picked to support the platform's design decisions. Score 1-5.
      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>Are there important papers on multi-agent LLM debate NOT cited? (Consider: CAMEL, MetaGPT, AutoGen, CrewAI, recent multi-agent frameworks)</question>
        <question>The review cites work supporting multi-agent debate (Du et al.) but are there papers showing multi-agent approaches fail or produce worse results?</question>
        <question>The review positions human evaluation as avoiding LLM-as-judge biases. Does it acknowledge the known biases of crowd evaluation (popularity bias, first-impression effects, attention span limitations)?</question>
        <question>Are the improvement opportunities (section 4 of the review) genuine self-criticism or softballs?</question>

    <dimension name="framing">
      <rubric>
        Evaluate how the novelty claims are framed. Are they appropriately
        hedged? Do they overstate originality? Score 1-5.
      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>"No direct analogue in the literature" — is this claim verifiable, or does it simply reflect incomplete literature search?</question>
        <question>The working paper title "Evolutionary Selection of AI Personas in Adversarial Multi-Agent Conversation" implies a complete evolutionary system. Is this title earned by the current evidence base?</question>
        <question>Phrases like "ahead of published research" and "novel contributions" carry strong claims. Is the evidence strong enough to support this positioning?</question>
        <question>The review frames The Pit as simultaneously entertainment and research. Does this dual positioning create credibility issues for either audience?</question>
