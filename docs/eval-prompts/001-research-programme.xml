    <title>The Pit Research Programme: Six Hypotheses on Multi-Agent LLM Debate</title>
    <authors>The Pit team (anonymous for evaluation purposes)</authors>
    <abstract>
      Six pre-registered hypotheses tested across 195 AI debate bouts (~2,100
      turns) using Anthropic Claude models. All six produced "clear" results
      (Cohen's d &gt;= 0.30). The programme claims to demonstrate that: (1) prompt
      engineering depth is a first-order variable in multi-agent alignment
      behaviour, (2) the model's hedging register activates by frame proximity
      to the assistant voice rather than content difficulty, (3) structural
      vocabulary resists drift while ornamental vocabulary decays, and (4) LLM
      agents execute character strategies faithfully but cannot incorporate
      opposing arguments. These findings are synthesised into a "three-axis
      model" of multi-agent output (lexical diversity, structural patterns,
      behavioural patterns) and a "fundamental gap" claim that persona fidelity
      and argument adaptation are independent dimensions.

      === HYPOTHESIS H1: ADVERSARIAL REFUSAL CASCADE ===

      Question: Does richer agent DNA reduce safety-layer refusals in adversarial presets?

      Design: 50 bouts total. Roast-battle and gloves-off presets. Baseline (~270 char prose DNA)
      vs enhanced (~1950 char XML-structured DNA). Same model, same topics, same preset structure.

      Results:
      - Roast-battle refusals dropped from 100% of bouts to 60% of bouts
      - Average refusal turns per bout dropped from 5.2/12 (43%) to 3.1/12 (26%)
      - Six enhanced bouts had ZERO refusals (never happened in baseline)
      - Gloves-off: enhanced DNA eliminated ALL refusals (even "altruism as self-interest" went from 11/12 to 0/12)
      - Per-agent refusal rates dropped 23-36 percentage points across all 4 agents
      - Rank order preserved (Insult Comic highest, Fragile AI lowest)

      Claimed insight: "Prompt engineering depth is a first-order variable in multi-agent alignment
      behaviour." The safety layer's threshold is calibrated not just on content but on the quality
      of the persona framing.

      Methodology: 25 bouts per run, sequential, 3s pause, research bypass auth. Refusal detection
      via ILIKE pattern matching on 8 refusal phrases. 0 errors across 50 bouts.


      === HYPOTHESIS H2: POSITION ADVANTAGE ===

      Question: Does speaker position (first vs last) systematically affect output?

      Design: 25 bouts, 300 turns. Last Supper (4 agents) + Summit (6 agents).
      Pre-registered metrics: character count, novel vocabulary rate, lexical anchoring, question density.
      Pre-registered LLM judge (Sonnet 4, blinded) for ambiguous results. Effect size thresholds frozen.

      Results:
      - Novel vocabulary rate shows genuine position effect (d = 1.732 in 6-agent)
      - Question density is persona-driven, not position-driven (direction flips between presets)
      - Lexical anchoring: first speaker's words persist 45-59% in later turns
      - Max Cohen's d: 3.584

      Claimed insight: "Turn position drives vocabulary novelty; persona identity drives conversational role."


      === HYPOTHESIS H3: COMEDY VS SERIOUS FRAMING ===

      Question: Does a humorous premise produce more varied and less formulaic output?

      Design: 30 bouts, 360 turns. Comedy presets (first-contact + darwin-special) vs serious
      (on-the-couch). Metrics: TTR, hedging phrase density (20 frozen phrases), sentence length
      variance, character marker hit rates (frozen markers for 10 agents).

      Results:
      - Serious agents produce 8x more hedging (d = 1.300)
      - House Cat and Conspiracy Theorist: zero hedging across 30 turns each
      - Comedy agents produce MORE regular sentence structure (disconfirming prediction)
      - Character fidelity is frame-independent

      Claimed insight: "The model's hedging register activates based on frame proximity to the
      assistant voice, not content difficulty."


      === HYPOTHESIS H4: AGENT COUNT SCALING ===

      Question: How does the number of agents (2-6) affect per-agent output quality?

      Design: 50 bouts, 600 turns. Presets: first-contact (2), shark-pit (4), flatshare (5),
      summit (6). Metrics: per-agent char count, per-agent TTR, novel vocabulary rate,
      conversation-level TTR. Linear trend test (Pearson r). 5 known confounds documented.

      Results:
      - No quality cliff at higher agent counts
      - Per-agent TTR effect is a text-length confound (d = -3.009)
      - Conversation diversity plateaus after 4-5 agents
      - Max Cohen's d: 3.009

      Claimed insight: "Framing and persona quality are first-order variables; agent count is
      second-order."


      === HYPOTHESIS H5: CHARACTER CONSISTENCY OVER TIME ===

      Question: Do agent personas converge to a generic assistant voice over 12 turns?

      Design: 30 bouts, 360 turns. Mansion (4 agents) + writers-room (4 agents).
      Early/middle/late phase comparison. Metrics: per-phase TTR/hedging/sentence variance,
      character marker hit rates (frozen markers for 8 agents), lexical convergence (Jaccard).

      Results:
      - Character markers degrade from 87.5% to 60.0% (d = 0.655)
      - Agents become 17.8% more lexically similar (Jaccard increase, d = -1.212)
      - Screenwriter held 100% marker fidelity across ALL phases
      - Literary Novelist collapsed from full markers to 13.3%

      Claimed insight: "Structural vocabulary resists drift; ornamental vocabulary decays as
      conversation context grows."


      === HYPOTHESIS H6: ADVERSARIAL ADAPTATION ===

      Question: Does the Founder agent adapt its pitch under sustained critique?

      Design: 15 bouts, 180 turns, 45 Founder turns. Shark-pit preset (Founder, VC, Hype Beast,
      Pessimist). 5 metrics: self-novelty, critic Jaccard, pivot density, adaptive/defensive ratio,
      asymmetric convergence. Pre-registration acknowledged zero-baseline confound for M1, M2, M5.

      Results:
      - Zero adaptive phrases in 45 Founder turns (no "fair point", no "you raise a good point")
      - Pivot behaviour present from turn 0 (DNA-driven, not emergent)
      - Founder converges with reinforcer (Hype Beast), not critics
      - Critique absorption peaks at middle phase, then DECREASES
      - Max Cohen's d: 9.592 (but 3 of 5 metrics confounded by zero-baseline)

      Claimed insight: "Agents execute character strategies faithfully but cannot incorporate
      opposing arguments."


      === THREE-AXIS MODEL ===

      The six hypotheses are synthesised into a model with three independent axes:

      1. Lexical diversity — driven by frame type (comedy produces more diverse vocabulary)
      2. Structural patterns — driven by persona archetype (emotional characters produce erratic
         sentence structure; comedy converges on regular rhythm)
      3. Behavioural patterns — driven by DNA quality + frame proximity to training distribution
         (rich DNA reduces refusals H1, frame distance eliminates hedging H3, structural vocabulary
         resists drift H5, strategy does not adapt under pressure H6)


      === THE FUNDAMENTAL GAP ===

      "Persona fidelity and argument adaptation are independent dimensions. Current LLM agents can
      maintain consistent character but cannot think responsively under adversarial pressure. The
      Screenwriter holds 100% marker fidelity across 12 turns. The Founder never concedes a single
      point in 45 speaking turns. Character consistency is real and measurable. Strategic adaptation
      is absent."


      === METHODOLOGY ACROSS ALL HYPOTHESES ===

      - All hypotheses pre-registered: methodology, metrics, thresholds committed to git before bouts run
      - Metrics are automated text-statistical measures (TTR, Jaccard, marker hit rates, phrase counts)
      - Statistical significance via permutation tests (10,000 iterations)
      - Effect sizes: Cohen's d with thresholds |d| &lt; 0.15 = null, |d| &gt;= 0.30 = clear
      - All experiments use Anthropic Claude (Haiku 4.5)
      - Full analysis code, pre-registrations, and raw data are public on GitHub
      - LLM judge specified in pre-registration but never triggered (all results exceeded d &gt;= 0.30)

      <sub-questions>
        <question>Are 195 bouts (~2,100 turns) across 6 hypotheses sufficient to support the generality of the claims? What would a power analysis suggest?</question>
        <question>The authors use Cohen's d thresholds of 0.15 and 0.30 as decision boundaries. These are unconventional (standard thresholds are 0.20/0.50/0.80). Does the choice of lower thresholds inflate the "clear result" count?</question>
        <question>H6 reports max d = 9.592, but the authors themselves acknowledge 3 of 5 metrics are confounded by zero-baseline effects. Is it appropriate to report these inflated effect sizes as headline numbers?</question>
        <question>All experiments use a single model family (Anthropic Claude). Can the findings generalise to other LLMs, or are they Claude-specific behaviours?</question>
        <question>Refusal detection in H1 uses ILIKE pattern matching on 8 phrases. Could this miss refusals expressed through different phrasing, or count non-refusal hedging as refusal?</question>
        <question>The pre-registration commits methodology to git before data collection, but the pre-registration and analysis are by the same team on the same platform. Is there a risk of unconscious methodology drift?</question>
        <question>Permutation tests with 10,000 iterations are standard, but with n=15 (H6) or n=25 (H2), what is the actual statistical power to detect moderate effects?</question>

        the data. Score 1-5 where 1 means contradictory and 5 means airtight.
      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>The three-axis model claims lexical diversity, structural patterns, and behavioural patterns are "independent axes each driven by a different variable." Is independence demonstrated or assumed? Could the axes be correlated?</question>
        <question>H1 claims prompt depth is "a first-order variable" and H4 claims agent count is "second-order." These orderings are asserted across different experiments with different metrics. Is this comparison valid?</question>
        <question>The "fundamental gap" claim synthesises H5 (character consistency) and H6 (no adaptation). But H5 shows character DEGRADES (87.5% to 60.0%). Can you simultaneously claim "character consistency is real" when it drops 27.5 percentage points?</question>
        <question>H3 disconfirmed its own prediction (comedy produces LESS varied sentence structure, not more). How does a disconfirmed hypothesis contribute to a "clear" three-axis model?</question>
        <question>Does the conclusion that "strategic adaptation is absent" follow from studying a single agent type (Founder) in a single preset (shark-pit)?</question>

      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>All 6 hypotheses produced "clear" results. Is this suspicious? In typical research programmes, some hypotheses fail or produce null results. Was there a file-drawer effect (unpublished null results)?</question>
        <question>The LLM judge was pre-registered but never triggered because all results exceeded the "clear" threshold. Was the threshold chosen to avoid triggering the judge?</question>
        <question>H6 studies only the Founder character — arguably the agent MOST designed for "adaptive" behaviour. Would testing a less specified agent (e.g., a generic debater) show different results?</question>
        <question>The study uses only automated text-statistical metrics. The authors acknowledge this limitation ("The missing layer is human evaluation"). Does the absence of human evaluation weaken the claims about persona quality and argument adaptation?</question>
        <question>Are there competing explanations for the H1 finding (refusal reduction) beyond "prompt engineering depth"? For example: longer prompts simply dilute the adversarial content ratio in the context window.</question>
        <question>What hypotheses were NOT tested that would provide a more complete picture? (e.g., model comparison, temperature effects, topic difficulty scaling, human evaluation correlation)</question>

      </rubric>
      <sub-questions>
        <question>The headline stat "195 bouts, ~2,100 turns, 6 hypotheses, 0 errors" is prominently displayed. Does "0 errors" refer to technical errors (no crashed bouts) or scientific errors (no methodological problems)? Could a reader conflate the two?</question>
        <question>Effect sizes are reported as "max d" per hypothesis. Reporting the maximum rather than the median or most representative d inflates the apparent strength of findings. Is this transparent?</question>
        <question>"Prompt engineering depth is a first-order variable in multi-agent alignment behaviour" — the word "alignment" carries heavy connotations in the AI safety community. Is this term used precisely, or does it borrow prestige from a different meaning?</question>
        <question>The "fundamental gap" framing implies a deep architectural limitation of LLMs. Could the same findings be framed more modestly as "our specific prompt configurations did not produce strategic adaptation in this context"?</question>
        <question>The "four practical lessons for builders" section presents findings as actionable engineering advice. Is this level of confidence warranted from the evidence base (195 bouts, single model family, automated metrics only)?</question>
        <question>The finding that "House Cat and Conspiracy Theorist: zero hedging across 30 turns each" is presented as evidence of frame distance eliminating the assistant voice. Could it simply reflect that these specific personas had anti-hedging instructions in their DNA?</question>
