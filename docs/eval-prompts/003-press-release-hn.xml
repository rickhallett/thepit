    <title>The Pit Launch Copy — Cross-Platform</title>
    <authors>The Pit team (anonymous for evaluation purposes)</authors>
    <abstract>
      Planned launch copy for Hacker News (Show HN post + first comment),
      Twitter/X (5-tweet thread), Reddit (4 subreddits), Discord, and Product
      Hunt. The copy positions The Pit as a research platform disguised as
      entertainment, emphasising on-chain agent identity, structured agent DNA,
      a micro-credit economy, and behavioural research findings. The strategy
      document explicitly instructs "Lead with findings, not product" and
      "Avoid AI tells" (no "revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge").

      === HACKER NEWS: SHOW HN POST ===

      Title: Show HN: The Pit -- Multi-agent AI debate arena with on-chain agent identity

      Body: I built a real-time multi-agent debate arena where AI personas clash
      turn-by-turn via server-sent events. Users pick preset scenarios (roast battles,
      diplomatic summits, writers' rooms) or build custom lineups, then watch
      Claude-powered agents argue, persuade, and occasionally say something
      genuinely surprising.

      The interesting part isn't the entertainment -- it's the data. Every bout
      generates structured behavioral research data: turn-level transcripts, crowd
      reactions (heart/fire per turn), and winner votes. We're studying which
      persona configurations persuade most effectively, how agents behave under
      pressure, and what crowds reward.

      Tech stack: Next.js 16, Neon PostgreSQL (Drizzle ORM), Anthropic Claude
      (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus), Clerk auth, Stripe micro-credits, Vercel.

      === HACKER NEWS: FIRST COMMENT ===

      A few things that might interest this crowd:

      On-chain agent identity. Every agent's prompt DNA is SHA-256 hashed and can
      be attested on-chain via Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) on Base L2.
      This gives you tamper detection, lineage verification across clone chains,
      and an immutable identity record that the platform can't alter. Not every
      project needs blockchain, but provenance tracking for AI-generated personas
      is a legitimate use case.

      Micro-credit economy. Atomic preauthorization with conditional SQL (UPDATE
      WHERE balance &gt;= amount) to prevent race conditions. Settlement happens
      after the bout completes with actual token usage. Hardened after an
      adversarial code review that found several timing attacks.

      Agent DNA system. Agents have structured "DNA" -- archetype, tone, quirks,
      opening moves, signature moves, weaknesses, goals, fears. Clone an agent,
      tweak the DNA, and the platform tracks the lineage up to 4 generations.
      We're studying how prompts evolve when users remix them.


      === TWITTER/X: 5-TWEET THREAD ===

      Tweet 1: I built a real-time AI debate arena where multiple AI agents argue
      turn-by-turn and you watch it happen live. 22 preset scenarios. Custom lineups.
      Clone and remix agents. Crowd reactions and winner votes.

      Tweet 2: The interesting problem: streaming multiple AI agents in sequence.
      Each agent sees the full transcript so far. Round-robin turns via SSE.
      120-second timeout for 12-turn bouts with thinking indicators. The UX had
      to feel live, not "loading..."

      Tweet 3: Every agent has structured "DNA" beyond a system prompt: Archetype,
      tone, quirks. Opening move, signature move. Weakness, goal, fears. Clone any
      agent. Tweak the DNA. The platform tracks lineage up to 4 generations.
      Studying how prompts evolve when remixed.

      Tweet 4: The credit economy was harder than expected. Atomic preauthorization
      before the bout starts. Settlement after with actual token usage. Conditional
      SQL to prevent race conditions. An adversarial code review found timing
      attacks in the first version. Now hardened.

      Tweet 5: Everything is open source (AGPL-3.0) and the research data feeds
      into studies on multi-agent persona dynamics. Which personas persuade? What
      do crowds reward? How do prompts drift across clone chains?


      === STRATEGY NOTES (internal) ===

      Key talking points:
      1. Lead with findings, not product.
      2. On-chain provenance is a differentiator.
      3. Open source builds trust.
      4. The research angle justifies the product.
      5. Avoid AI tells. No "revolutionary," "game-changing," "cutting-edge."
      6. Credit economy is a technical story.

      Predicted criticisms prepared for:
      - "Just a wrapper / toy"
      - "Why not open source the models?"
      - "Debates are repetitive"
      - "Persona impersonation ethics"
      - "Why would I pay?"
      - "AI slop"


      === UNDERLYING EVIDENCE BASE ===

      The launch copy references these research findings (from 195 bouts, ~2100 turns):
      - Prompt depth reduces refusals (H1: roast-battle 100% to 60%)
      - Position effects on vocabulary novelty (H2: d=1.732)
      - Comedy framing eliminates hedging (H3: 8x difference)
      - No quality cliff at higher agent counts (H4)
      - Character markers degrade over 12 turns (H5: 87.5% to 60%)
      - Agents cannot adapt strategy under pressure (H6: 0/45 adaptive phrases)

      The copy also references features that are implemented but not yet live:
      - EAS on-chain attestation (code exists, not enabled in production)
      - Clone chain lineage tracking (data model exists, UI for lineage browsing is partial)

      The copy references the research programme but does not present specific
      findings in the launch posts — it frames them as "we're studying" rather
      than "we found."

        <question>The HN title says "on-chain agent identity" but the feature is implemented in code but NOT live in production. Is this misleading?</question>
        <question>"We're studying which persona configurations persuade most effectively" — is "persuade" the right word? The research measures text-statistical metrics (TTR, Jaccard, marker hit rates), not persuasiveness as judged by humans.</question>
        <question>"Hardened after an adversarial code review that found several timing attacks" — is this verifiable from the public repo? Does it risk sounding like security theatre?</question>
        <question>The copy says the platform tracks lineage "up to 4 generations." Is this a technical limitation or a design choice? Is it presented accurately?</question>

        <question>"Occasionally say something genuinely surprising" — is this a defensible claim or subjective hype?</question>
        <question>The first comment leads with the blockchain angle. On HN, blockchain mentions can be polarising. Is this the right lead for this audience?</question>
        <question>The Twitter thread is structured as a builder's journey ("I built", "the interesting problem", "harder than expected"). Does this framing earn trust or feel formulaic?</question>
        <question>The strategy says "the research angle justifies the product." Does the copy successfully make research feel like the genuine purpose, or does it read as retroactive justification for an entertainment product?</question>

            "AI debate arena" competes with hundreds of similar-sounding
            projects. The differentiation needs to land in tweet 1. The
            thread format (builder journey) is well-worn on X. The research
            angle is the differentiator but it's in tweet 5 (lowest read-
            through). The credit economy tweet (4) is technically interesting
            but niche.
