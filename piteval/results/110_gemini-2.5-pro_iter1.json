The code is highly modular, with clear separation of concerns, which is indicative of an atomic commit practice. File headers are descriptive and explain the 'why' of each module, a habit that typically extends to commit messages. Given the extraordinary discipline shown in testing and documentation, it is highly probable that the commit history is clean, descriptive, and tells the story of the project's evolution. A score of 7 reflects a practice that goes well beyond the norm for a solo developer, where the git log likely reads as a clear changelog.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"The codebase is highly modular, with files like `lib/agent-dna.ts`, `lib/bout-engine.ts`, and `lib/rate-limit.ts` each handling a single, well-defined responsibility, suggesting an atomic approach to changes.\",\n        \"File headers throughout the `lib/` directory are exceptionally descriptive, explaining the purpose and design of each module (e.g., `lib/agent-dna.ts`, `lib/eas.ts`), which is a strong proxy for disciplined, descriptive commit messages.\",\n        \"The prompt context explicitly mentions 'conventional commits' as a practice maintained by the developer, which is a core tenet of disciplined commit culture.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"metric_id\": \"110.2\",\n      \"metric_name\": \"Research and Intellectual Rigor\",\n      \"score\": 9,\n      \"reasoning\": \"The project demonstrates a level of intellectual rigor that is rare outside of dedicated research teams, let alone in a solo project built in two weeks. The developer has not just built a product, but a research platform. There is clear evidence of pre-registered hypotheses, a full literature review, automated metrics, statistical analysis, and self-critical acknowledgment of limitations. This is a systematic, hypothesis-driven approach to development that is exceptionally impressive and would be a strong signal in any engineering organization. It stops just short of a 10 because there's no evidence of external validation like peer review, but it's at the absolute peak of what a solo developer could achieve.\",\n      \"evidence\": [\n        \"`pitstorm/cmd/hypothesis/hypotheses.go` defines seven specific, pre-registered hypotheses (H1-H7) with clear methodologies, demonstrating a formal research process.\",\n        \"`app/research/citations/page.tsx` contains a comprehensive literature review with 18 citations, grounding the project in existing academic work.\",\n        \"`app/research/page.tsx` explicitly acknowledges the limitations of the initial findings, such as the potential bias from threshold choices, showing intellectual honesty.\",\n        \"`lib/eval/` directory contains code for automated, objective evaluation of agent performance on metrics like persona adherence and format compliance.\",\n        \"`pitstorm/cmd/analyze/` contains Go code for post-hoc analysis, including permutation tests and effect size calculations (Cohen's d), indicating rigorous statistical analysis.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"metric_id\": \"110.3\",\n      \"metric_name\": \"Documentation as Engineering Practice\",\n      \"score\": 8,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Documentation is clearly treated as a first-class engineering artifact. The file headers across the `lib/` directory are exemplary, explaining not just the 'what' but the 'why' behind architectural decisions.

The inclusion of a full OpenAPI spec for the API demonstrates a professional, product-oriented mindset.

The presence of a specific regression test for a caught bug (`tests/unit/credits-settle.test.ts`) is the strongest possible evidence that testing is used as a tool for building a reliable safety net, enabling high-velocity development.

Building this much functionality, with this level of testing and documentation, in under two weeks is evidence of extremely high and effective velocity. The developer has made conscious, strategic shortcuts to achieve this speed, and crucially, has documented them. The in-memory rate limiter and anomaly detector are perfect examples: they provide a good-enough solution for launch while explicitly noting their limitations and the path to a more robust implementation.
