# slopodar.yaml — Anti-patterns of LLM authenticity
#
# A living inventory of tells, tics, and tendencies that make LLM output
# sound like LLM output. Each entry is a pattern to watch for and ward off.
#
# Named after the radar that detects slop before it reaches production.
# Maintained by the Captain and crew. Entries are added when caught
# in the wild.
#
# Format:
#   - id: short kebab-case identifier
#     name: human-readable name
#     detected: date first caught
#     trigger: the specific text or pattern that surfaced this
#     description: what the pattern is and why it's a problem
#     signal: what it communicates to a discerning reader
#     instead: what a human would actually write
#     severity: low | medium | high
#     refs: where it was caught (SD number, file, context)

    trigger: "15 systems mapped to 7 literature domains"
    description: >
      The LLM substitutes enumeration for substance. Precise counts
      deployed as rhetorical authority — "6 constructs," "15 systems,"
      "7 domains" — when the numbers add nothing. The count performs
      rigor without demonstrating it. A human who found genuine
      connections between their work and the literature would talk
      about the connections, not inventory them.
    signal: >
      To a discerning reader (HN, hiring manager, researcher): this
      person didn't write this. A human says "the governance systems
      keep turning up in distributed cognition research." An LLM says
      "15 engineering systems mapped to 7 literature domains."
    instead: >
      "The engineering work maps onto distributed cognition research
      in ways I didn't expect." Let the table speak for itself.
      The reader can count.

    trigger: "caught in the wild — not theorised in advance"
    description: >
      Negative-positive antithesis where the negation adds zero
      information. The classical form ("not A, but B") is a deliberate
      rhetorical choice — Aristotle documented it. The LLM form is
      an RLHF-trained reflex: contrastive structures score higher in
      preference rankings, so the model generates them compulsively.
      "Caught in the wild" already implies "not theorised." The
      negation is dead weight that makes the sentence sound like a
      TED talk.
    signal: >
      Pre-LLM, this was a stylistic choice with real rhetorical force.
      Post-LLM, everyone uses AI as their copyeditor and this
      construction is everywhere. A discerning reader now pattern-matches
      it as AI-generated prose. The structure that once signalled
      decisiveness now signals "a model wrote this."
    instead: >
      Just say the positive. "Entries are added when caught in the
      wild." The reader does not need to be told what the alternative
      was. If the contrast genuinely adds meaning, keep it. If the
      reader already knows the negated term, cut it.
