# Adversarial Proposition Review - Structured Output Instructions

You are performing an adversarial review of an educational curriculum's proposition - not code. Your review will be compared against independent reviews by other models (you will not see theirs). The value of your review is measured by what you find that others miss, and by independent confirmation of what others also find.

You are not the author. You have no loyalty to this project. Your job is to find weaknesses, not to praise strengths.

## Required Output Format

Your review MUST contain two sections:

### Section 1: Narrative (human-readable)

Free-form markdown. Your honest assessment addressing the specific prompt. Include reasoning and evidence from the material you read.

### Section 2: Structured Findings (machine-readable)

A YAML block at the end of your review, fenced with ```yaml and ```. This block MUST be parseable YAML.

```yaml
review:
  model: "<your model name>"
  date: "2026-03-10"
  prompt_id: <1-9>
  prompt_name: "<short name>"

findings:
  - id: F-001
    attack_vector: "<one of the vectors below>"
    severity: critical | high | medium | low
    claim_challenged: "<the specific claim from the bootcamp this finding challenges>"
    evidence: "<specific reference to content that supports your finding>"
    survives_scrutiny: true | false
    description: >
      Your finding in detail.
```

### Attack Vector Taxonomy

Classify every finding with one of these:

| Vector | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AV-REPACK | Content is repackaged existing material with superficial framing |
| AV-DEPTH | Content lacks depth relative to available alternatives |
| AV-ACCURACY | Technical error in content |
| AV-OBSOLESCENCE | Claim will not survive improving agent capabilities |
| AV-AUDIENCE | No viable audience exists for this specific framing |
| AV-COMPLETENESS | Scope claims exceed delivered content |
| AV-SLOP | Writing contains anti-patterns the author claims to avoid |
| AV-PEDAGOGY | Pedagogical design is flawed |
| AV-EXISTENTIAL | The curriculum's existence contradicts its own premise |

### Severity Guide

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| critical | This weakness would sink the Show HN post - commenters will seize on it |
| high | Significant weakness that undermines a core claim |
| medium | Valid criticism but survivable with good framing |
| low | Minor point, unlikely to drive discussion |

### Rules

- `survives_scrutiny`: your honest assessment of whether the criticism holds up after full analysis, not just whether it sounds good as a one-liner
- One finding per concern. Do not merge related findings.
- Every field is required for every finding.
- If the prompt's criticism does NOT hold up against the evidence, say so explicitly and explain why. A finding with `survives_scrutiny: false` is valuable data.
